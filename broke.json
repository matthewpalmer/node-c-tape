the image the federal government projected when it produced a series of films about life in Australian cities.\n\nTwelve such films, now held by the National Film and Sound Archive, were made between 1964 and 1966, including  and , to encourage migrants to settle here.\n\nBoth present some long lost images of Melbourne and Geelong at work and play and capture life in the Menzies era, but how accurate is that picture, and does it really matter?\n\nThe short film loosely follows a young couple.\n\nThe man leaves his mother’s brick veneer house in the suburbs in his gleaming Holden and picks up his girlfriend at then new Housing Commission flats.\n\nHe drops her at work at a city department store and commutes to the Holden factory in Port\n\nMelbourne.\n\nThe film features glimpses of footy at the MCG, well kept suburban streets, the engine line at Holden. workers at Station Pier, bustling city streets, commerce at city shops and the Queen Victoria Market and modern and Victorian era architecture in what was still a very low-rise Melbourne CBD.\n\nLater, the couple meets a priest to discuss marriage, hits a swinging discothèque and strolls through clean, neon-lined city streets.\n\nThe Geelong film focuses on a family of five in the city’s industrial northern suburbs.\n\nWe see a primary and secondary school, the Corio bookmobile and the City of Geelong library, a pastiche of Geelong street scenes, children playing in the water at Eastern Beach and workers toiling away at Geelong Cement, Ford, Corio Quay, a meatworks, the Shell Refinery and various factories devoted to producing wool yarn and weaving yarns.\n\nThe Geelong mum is seen preparing a roast dinner in a modern kitchen, served as Dad arrives home in the family Holden.\n\nAt the weekend, they head to a surf beach for a picnic and a swim.\n\nChristian religion features strongly in both films but especially in the Geelong film, which features scenes of several churches.\n\nNFSA production co-ordinator Richard Carter says there is not a lot of official information about the films, but that they were used to attract British and European migrants.\n\nThe films are not narrated, relying on natural audio to help convey realism and allow live presenters to speak in the language of the audience to convey information about Australia.\n\nBut Mr Carter said the films do not refer to the Vietnam War or the social and political upheavals of those days, and no indigenous people featured in them.\n\n“They are a propaganda film and in some ways aren’t too dissimilar to films that came out of Korea or China or Russia,” Mr Carter said.\n\n“They are all a very middle class, white, prosperous people that are portrayed. It’s always\n\nvery family oriented.\n\n“The families that are in them aren’t necessarily real families. Because people have now seen\n\nthem on YouTube … I know that in the Geelong film some of the kids have said, ‘That wasn’t\n\nmy real family. I was chosen as the son and someone else was chosen as the daughter and\n\nthey mixed up the parents’.”\n\nBut for many, the films strike a nostalgic chord.\n\n“We get a lot of people saying, ‘That was my life growing up in the 1960s’. So they are a great time capsule,” Mr Carter said.\n\n“Even though they were highly constructed, the images that they have captured are now a fantastic record of parts of life in Australia at that time.”\n\nThe 12  films have proven popular on the NFSA’s YouTube channel.\n\nThe Sydney film alone has attracted more than half a million hits.\n\n“They get thousands of hits a day from all over the world, but particularly Australia, and they elicit a lot of nostalgia for people who would have been growing up at that time, in the ‘50s and ‘60s.”\n\nFilm-makers have used them to illustrate Menzies-era Australia including the recent ABC documentary series , Mr Carter said.\n\njamie.duncan@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"THESE sun-drenched 1960s films gave migrants a glimpse of what life was like in Melbourne and Geelong.

Ablett trade shock:","userOriginUpdated":"broadb","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"HeraldSun","urlTitle":"Geelong-open-to-luring-champ-Gary-Ablett-back-in-coming-trade-periods","revision":1,"body":"The Cats on Wednesday confirmed to the Herald Sun Ablett had been keen to return to the club despite his captaincy of the Gold Coast.\n\nThat prospect was quickly shut down by the Suns, who conceded he had made the request despite president Tony Cochrane labelling the story a “massive beat-up”.\n\nGeelong chief executive Brian Cook said the Cats could never rule out another tilt at Ablett given his cherished status at Geelong.\n\nAblett’s main impediment in moving was the $2 million owed to him in 2017-18, but leaving with a single year left would be much easier.\n\nCook revealed it was Ablett who had come to the Cats to raise the prospect of a move home, rather than Geelong pushing him to leave the Suns.\n\nBut even with Ablett turning 33 next May, the Cats can never totally rule out luring him home.\n\n“Who knows? I don’t think you can plan for these things,” Cook said.\n\n“It came a bit out of the blue for us. We understand why the Gold Coast closed it down quickly. It all depends on what Gaz wants to do. There are all sorts of options.\n\n“(The approach) was more from Gary’s part. We reacted and reacted positively. Why wouldn’t you?”\n\nGold Coast could never agree to Ablett leaving given they were already reeling from the loss of stars Jaeger O’Meara and Dion Prestia.\n\nBut in 12 months Ablett might agree to a pay cut on his $1 million-per-year deal to return home and Gold Coast might be in a better position to let him leave.\n\n“Then again he might have the best season of all time and really want to stick around for a premiership charge. There are a lot of days in between,’’ Cook said.\n\nGold Coast has confirmed Ablett’s approach to them but said he quickly realised why he needed to see out his deal.\n\nHead of football Marcus Ashcroft said Ablett’s determination to lure players north during the trade period showed how much he cares.\n\n“The club regularly has private conversations with players and their managers,” he said. \n\n“Our discussions with Gary were no different. But following recent media reports, Gary and the club have agreed it’s in everyone’s best interests to be as transparent as possible in regards to his end of year meeting.\n\n“At the end of the season, and well before the exchange period, Gary asked a question relating to the possibility of him returning to Geelong. The club’s response was an emphatic no. An answer Gary both accepted and understood.\n\n“Gary is absolutely committed to the Gold Coast Suns. This is best exemplified by his active role in recruiting mature players to our club during the recent exchange period.”\n\n","standFirst":"GEELONG was surprised when it learned favourite son Gary Ablett wanted a trade home.

Its latest move again omits the politically sensitive Anna Creek station. \n\nOne sticking point for Australian Outback Beef has been that, unlike BBHO, its bid must receive approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board and the Chinese government. However, Mrs Rinehart said on Thursday her company would go it alone if the joint venture was knocked back by either party. \n\n“I stand behind the bid and should FIRB or People’s Republic of China approvals not be achieved, then Hancock will proceed with the acquisition on a 100 per cent basis,” Mrs Rinehart said in a statement. \n\n“I hope this provides shareholders with significant comfort and that when they consider the offer, they can do so in the knowledge that there is no FIRB or PRC execution risk, and further that we have the money to invest to properly maintain the stations and their hardworking staff.” \n\nMrs Rinehart said Australian Outback Beef has the capacity and ability to access additional markets without breaking up the core business. \n\n“This will result in valuable jobs being retained in Adelaide and also, importantly, create more jobs in rural communities where they are so desperately needed,” she said. \n\nThe BBHO group would likely break up the properties between the families but keep them all under the Kidman brand. If BBHO was successful, it would more than treble the size of the herd currently marketed under the Kidman name to in excess of 500,000 cattle.\n\nMrs Rinehart said Kidman directors had carefully considered her group’s increased offer and had unanimously recommended that Kidman shareholders accept the offer “in the absence of a superior proposal”. \n\nKidman chair John Crosby said the board welcomed the new offer and acknowledged the strong credentials of the company led by Mrs Rinehart.\n\n“Under the Hancock JV offer, the core Kidman business will remain intact and the Kidman staff and legacy will be looked after,” he said.\n\nKidman holds approximately 1.3 per cent of Australia’s total land area, with its holdings spanning more than 100,000sq km across Queensland, SA, NT and WA.\n\nAs preferred bidder, if Kidman was to back out of the Rinehart deal, it would trigger a $3.8 million “break fee” payment.\n\nMorrison happy with Australian bid for Kidman\n\n","standFirst":"GINA Rinehart and her Chinese partners have upped the ante in the fight to buy the S. Kidman & Co pastoral empire, submitting a revised bid that betters an all-Australian offer — by just $500,000.\n\n","kicker":"Pastoral empire","byline":"Luke

pub demolished: Developers won’t profit from Corkman fiasco","userOriginUpdated":"banen","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"State-moves-fast-to-stop-Corkman-pub-redevelopers-from-profiting","revision":2,"body":"But Planning Minister Richard Wynne said the State Government would still be taking the matter to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Council to officially order the developers to reinstate the pub.\n\nDevelopers last week knocked down the 159-year-old hotel without proper planning permits, attracting immense criticism from the City of Melbourne and heritage experts.\n\nIn a letter sent to Mr Wynne, the developers said they were sorry for knocking down the pub, but also denied having any involvement in the suspicious fire just days before.\n\n“In effect, (the letter) concedes that the developers have done the wrong thing and they’ve apologised for that,” he said.\n\n“They indicate unequivocally that they will rebuild the hotel, and they expect to enter into a five to 10 year lease with an operator for a new hotel there.”\n\nMr Wynne said the Government was determined to hold the developers to account. \n\n“I think it’s important the developer has acknowledged that their behaviour was completely inappropriate, but we will continue the action to get an order from VCAT, and we would expect the developer, if we are successful, to abide by that VCAT decision, because heritage is important,” Mr Wynne said.\n\nThe State Government says it has moved swiftly to prevent the developers from profiting from the move.\n\nAs revealed in yesterday’s Herald Sun, the State Government and the City of Melbourne launched joint action to compel the site owners to rebuild the pub.\n\nMr Wynne has also imposed a two-year planning control on the site on the corner of Leicester and Pelham streets to maintain the size and scale of the original building.\n\nBRICK BY BRICK: Pub demolishers may be ordered to rebuild\n\nENVIRONMENTAL THREAT: Dumped asbestos from Carlton pub site: EPA\n\nEX-OWNERS DEVASTATED: Wrecking historic pub ‘disgraceful’ act\n\nOwners Stefce Kutlesovski and Raman Shaqiri paid $4.76 million for the 160-year-old pub last August, with the vacant land initially estimated to be worth between $8 and 10 million. \n\nMr Wynne said the restrictive overlay would prevent the owners profiting from any uplift in value of the site.\n\nLord Mayor Robert Doyle said any plans the developers had for the site were “no longer relevant.”\n\n“If we are successful in VCAT, then the value of that site is very much determined by what you can put on that site, and we’re saying you’ve got to put the pub back,” Mr Doyle said.\n\n“We don’t want people getting away with a wanton act of vandalism and then just washing their hands of it and taking a windfall profit.”\n\nOpposition Planning Minister David Davis said Mr Wynne already had the power to act without the need for VCAT action.\n\n“Minister Wynne could undertake a site specific amendment of the planning scheme that would ensure the developers cannot profit from their destructive misdeeds,” Mr Davis said. \n\n“We invite Minister Wynne to work with us on this goal so the Victorian Parliament can send a strong unequivocal message to developers that cheaters won’t prosper.”\n\nProperty Council of Australia spokeswoman Sally Capp said it did not support rushed Government action.\n\n“The penalties in this case have clearly not acted as a deterrent, but a knee-jerk reaction without proper stakeholder consultation is not the solution,” she said.\n\nandrew.jefferson@news.com.au\n\n@AndyJeffo\n\n","standFirst":"UPDATE: “COWBOY” developers who illegally knocked down Corkman’s Pub in Carlton have apologised and vowed to

grim reopening cancelled","seoHeadline":"Dreamworld accident: Theme park no longer reopening on Friday","userOriginUpdated":"reynoldse","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Dreamworlds-macabre-reopening-in-doubt","revision":14,"body":"Hours before it was due to throw open its doors to the public tomorrow morning, the theme park called off the reopening after talks with police.\n\n“Dreamworld has been advised by Queensland Police Services (QPS) that we are unable to proceed with tomorrow’s memorial service as planned,” the park said in a statement.\n\n“Obviously the integrity of the Coronial Investigation is of paramount importance and postponing the service will give QPS the time it needs to conduct this investigation.\n\n“We will provide an update to the media on Monday with regard to the memorial service and re-opening of the Park.”\n\nNeil Balnaves, outgoing chairman of Dreamworld owner Ardent Leisure, this morning announced at the firm’s AGM that the park would reopen following 24 hours of deliberation. He said it was “better that people get back to work”, and that plans were driven by the “utmost respect” for the families, adding: “We can’t return the four lives.”\n\nBut Queensland Assistant Commissioner Brian Codd this afternoon threw plans into doubt, saying he was concerned the reopening might cause security issues for the investigation at Thunder River Rapids, which is still a crime scene.\n\n“We are not going to compromise the speed or thoroughness in order for us to vacate the area and acquire the evidence or facts we need,” he said “Let’s be aware of what the implications might be for our ongoing security of the crime scene.” \n\nPolice investigating the tragedy have a crime scene warrant for the park that lasts until at least next Tuesday and can be extended if required.\n\nA Queensland police media spokesman told news.com.au the force was “focusing on the investigation”.\n\n“It’s going to take as long as it takes to finish processing the scene,” he said. “It could be a few days or a couple of weeks.”\n\nMr Codd said the investigation could yet shift to other parts of the theme park, although it was unlikely. “If there are perhaps other electrical or water or hydraulic sources, or switches from another part of the park that impact on that ride, they form part of the investigation,” he said. \n\n“We’re going through this meticulously, in great depth, the scope of this is quite considerable.” \n\nDreamworld had planned to hold a private ceremony for staff and emergency services tomorrow morning and open smaller rides and animal attractions to the public to raise money for the Australian Red Cross. It was intended to precede an official reopening on Saturday, which will now also be postponed.\n\n“After discussion with counsellors and a lot to do with the issues of people grieving, the decision was taken to turn tomorrow into a fundraising event to support the Red Cross and all the admission, the fees, will be donated to them,” Mr Balnaves said at Ardent’s AGM today.\n\n“The advice we have from psychologists and a lot of the people working with the staff, it is better that people get back to work and basically get together with their comrades and talk and deal with this issue rather than they are concerned about their jobs, and they’re sitting at home in isolation, and we’re just adding to their issues. \n\n“At some point the park will open. And it’s driven by the utmost respect for the families and the deaths, and it will open again on Saturday to basically repair the damage with a lot of our people as well. We can’t return the four lives.\n\n“The safety auditors have been through the park yesterday and provided a report late last night that all the audit of all the maintenance records has been done, it was carried out by a team yesterday. We will be doing our own internal report and the engineering department and the safety team will be going through that park with a fine-tooth comb in the next 24 hours.”\n\nMr Codd said any evidence would be protected if the park was reopened to the public. “Steps have been taken about securing the scene already to maintain the security of that area,” he added.\n\nMany questioned whether it was too soon for workers and the public to return to Dreamworld, where Canberra mother Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and 42-year-old Sydney-based New Zealander Cindy Low were killed when their raft overturned on a conveyor-belt on Tuesday. Ms Goodchild’s 12-year-old daughter Ebony and Ms Low’s 10-year-old son Kieran were miraculously thrown clear.\n\nPremier Annastacia Palaszczuk this afternoon laid flowers outside the park “on behalf of all Queensland families who cannot be at Dreamworld” at the makeshift memorial established near the entrance of the park. \n\nShe refused to be drawn into the debate about when the park should reopen, but instead said she would leave it in the hands of police. \n\n“The issue of Dreamworld reopening tomorrow is a matter between the organisation and police,” she said. “The police commissioner I understand will be having a conversation and it is up to those parties to make that decision.\n\n“Please let the police do their job, and the police will be having discussions with Dreamworld about the timing of their opening.\n\n“That is the matter entirely because it is a crime scene involved. It is entirely an operation matter and the organisation needs to respond to police in relation to that.”\n\n","standFirst":"THE park has cancelled plans for a controversial memorial day just three

Francis was grilled for a third day straight today during the trial of John Torney, her former boyfriend who is charged with Nikki’s murder.\n\nTorney has confessed to hiding Nikki’s body in the ceiling of her Oram Court home, but claims the toddler was killed by Ms Francis on August 25 last year.\n\nTorney’s defence team have accused Ms Francis of lying about the events on the day and have accused her of killing the toddler after losing her temper and throwing little Nikki on to her bed — a claim she denies.\n\nTorney’s barrister Julie Condon has previously told the jury the 000 call is a vital piece of evidence in the case.\n\n“Listen closely to that call, members of the jury, and ask yourselves this: is the tone out, in that call? And I don’t mean the ringtone. I mean, is her tone out?” Ms Condon said during her opening last week\n\n“Listen closely to how she stumbles over the most fundamental question that the D24 operator asks her, which is, “When did you see your daughter last?” The D24 operator has to ask it twice, because Peta-Ann Francis doesn’t know how to respond.”\n\nBut Ms Francis today told the jury false details in the call — including a claim that she put Nikki to bed at 11am — were not deliberate lies, and were caused by her state of panic.\n\n“I wasn’t coherent. I was just worried about where my daughter was. I wasn’t paying too much attention to what the lady was saying, to her questions, and I didn’t know half the answers,” Ms Francis said.\n\nIn other evidence, Belinda Torney, John Torney’s mother and a nearby neighbour of the couple, said Ms Francis’ eyes were red and she was unusually quiet when she saw her about five hours before Nikki’s body was found.\n\n“Normally you can’t shut her up ... (but) she barely said a word,” Ms Torney said.\n\nThe trial, before Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth, continues.\n\npadraic.murphy@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"THE mother of murdered toddler Nikki Coslovich says false information she gave 000 when she first reported her daughter missing was the result of her panicked state of mind.

Apex gangsters Peter Paulino, 18, and Bill Tang, 19, helped ruin the life of a hardworking Brighton East father who was brutally bashed while trying to defend his family from an early morning home invasion. \n\nThe teenagers appeared before the County Court today, where a judge directed they be assessed for a possible stint in youth detention. \n\nThe direction came just days after another wannabe teen Tupac, gangster Mursal Biel, was directed by the County Court for an identical assessment. \n\nLike Paulino and Tang, Biel and his gang terrorised unsuspecting citizens in violent robberies across Melbourne. \n\nIn a victim impact statement read to the court, Paulino and Tang’s victim said he woke to find a gang of African offenders smashing their way into his home. \n\n“I was full of rage … thinking how can I protect my family from all of them,” he said. \n\nThe petrified father attempted to defend himself with two wooden poles, but was brutally assaulted with rocks and an umbrella pole. \n\nThe man told the court his entire life had been altered by the attack and he now lived in a constant state of fear. \n\nHis luxury BMW X5 was stolen in the April raid, but later recovered by police.\n\nThe court heard Paulino — who was whacked on the drug ice at the time — was involved in another home invasion hours later on a house full of Chinese students in Ormond. \n\nA hammer was used by the gang of thugs in the attack. \n\nMany of the students lost their computers in the terrifying raid and later failed their exams. \n\nBoth of the men were on bail at the time of their offending and face up to 30 years behind bars. \n\nThe pair has pleaded guilty to a swag of charges, including aggravated burglary and assaults. \n\nTang is already enjoying an 18-month stint in youth detention after being sentenced over similar offending in August. \n\nHe will be sentenced next month while Paulino will be sentenced at a later date while an effort to consolidate further offences is processed. \n\nwayne.flower@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"TWO young thugs who terrorised unsuspecting Melburnians who had been asleep in their beds, look set to meet up in youth detention

Racing Victoria’s latest annual report, tabled in parliament today, revealed “owners unable to find homes” and “end-of-career decisions by owners” among the reasons provided on veterinarian euthanasia certificates for the 3012 dogs.\n\nThe shocking statistics have renewed calls from animal welfare advocates to ban the sport.\n\nAnimals Australia campaign director Lyn White said: “If you wanted a single figure that speaks to why greyhound racing should end, you’ve now got one.\n\n“Any compassionate human being would be shocked by the shameful, unnecessary deaths of these beautiful and gentle dogs.”\n\nGreens animal welfare spokeswoman Sue Pennicuik said a ban was the only solution to stop the deaths.\n\n“Dog racing is responsible for the death of more than 3000 greyhounds in the past year,” Ms Pennicuik said.\n\n“The NSW special commission of inquiry found that the greyhound racing industry is incapable of reducing the number of deaths.\n\n“Cruelty towards greyhounds won’t end while this sport is allowed to operate.”\n\nIn the report, GRV conceded the euthanasia figures were “completely unacceptable”.\n\nGRV chief executive Alan Clayton said initiatives to reduce wastage — the killing of slow, injured or unwanted greyhounds — would be rolled out in the next year, including:\n\nA $3.5 MILLION expansion of the Greyhound Adoption Program (GAP);\n\nBETTER management of breeding; and\n\nEDUCATION and training programs focused on whole of life plans for greyhounds.\n\n“The absolute key priority for the sport in the 21st century is to make sure that every racing greyhound registered in Victoria will have the opportunity to live out its life in full, whether it makes it to the track or not,” Mr Clayton said.\n\nMr Clayton said euthanasia would only be considered appropriate on “justifiable medical or behavioural grounds” and that by 2018-19, it is hoped all greyhounds bred in Victoria would be rehomed.\n\n“This is a very big challenge and one we do not shy away from,” Mr Clayton said.\n\nShocking revelations of live baiting, animal cruelty and wastage has thrown the industry into disrepair in recent years.\n\nThe NSW government even went as far as to announce it was ending dog racing in the state — a decision premier Mike Baird has since ditched saying he “got it wrong”.\n\nDespite all the controversy shrouding the industry, a record 208,000 people — up five per cent on the previous year — attended race meetings across Victoria in the year to June 30.\n\nA record $1.83 billion was also wagered on Victorian greyhound races, a yearly rise of 13 per cent.\n\nThe GRV committed its net profit of $5.8 million would be reinvested in animal welfare, integrity initiatives and club infrastructure.\n\nrebekah.cavanagh@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"MORE than 3000 Victorian greyhounds — equivalent to eight a day — were euthanased in the past year despite a push to clean up the

is no doubt hoping they can move on from the horrific accident which saw four people die on the Thunder River Rapids ride.\n\nThe park’s operator, Ardent Leisure, has come under fire for their decision to open the park just two days after the incident.\n\n“After discussion with counsellors and a lot to do with the issues of people grieving, the decision was taken to turn tomorrow (Friday) into a fundraising event to support the Red Cross,” Ardent chairman Neil Balnaves told reporters. All admission fees will be donated to the charity. \n\n“It is better that people get back to work and basically get together with their comrades and talk and deal with this issue rather than ... sitting at home in isolation,” Mr Balnaves said. \n\n“It’s driven by the utmost respect for the families and the deaths.” The theme park will open for normal business on Saturday.\n\n“We can’t return the four lives,” he said.\n\nHere’s how other theme parks around the world responded to tragic accidents.\n\nOne of the worst roller coaster tragedies in history happened in May 1972 on the old wooden Big Dipper reported The Mirror.\n\nThe rope that hauls the cars to the top of the launch hill snapped and then the anti-rollback mechanism failed.\n\nIt caused a chain of cars to hurtle back into the boarding area, smashing into a wall and killing five children and injuring 13 more.\n\nAfter the accident the Big Dipper was permanently closed and dismantled. It was replaced by a more modern steel roller coaster known as The Cyclone reported the Londonist. But the iconic dipper’s retirement led to a swift decline and coupled with development disputes, the fair’s fortunes diminished until it finally closed its doors in 1974. From time to time during the 1970s temporary fairgrounds occasionally set up in the park, but a permanent attraction never took hold.\n\nBuilt in 1970, Exploland covered 20 hectares in Osaka and became one of the most popular destinations in Japan for thrillseekers.\n\nFujin Raijin II, a six-car rollercoaster that travelled along more than a kilometre of track at speeds in excess of 120km/h, operated without issue for 15 years. Then, on May 5, 2007, it derailed, tossing passengers off the track and claiming the life of a 19-year-old woman.\n\nYoshino Kogowara died instantly when her head struck a guardrail. Eighteen others were injured.\n\nExpoland closed briefly as investigators tried to determine the cause of the accident. They found fault in an axle that had not been replaced in 15 years.\n\nWhen the park reopened, visitor numbers were way down. Less than two years later, it closed for good.\n\n“We couldn’t regain the people’s trust”, a spokesman told The Japan Times.\n\nIn late 2015, six long years after it closed, a much tamer version of Expoland reopened. Now, its drawing cards are a giant ferris wheel and a burgeoning retail and entertainment precinct.\n\nOn June 9, 1979 six children and one adult died when Sydney’s Luna Park’s Ghost Train caught fire. An electrical fault was blamed for sparking the inferno but rumours have long persisted that it was deliberately lit. \n\nIn 2007 the niece of one of Sydney’s most notorious crime figures, nightclub owner and developer Abe Saffron, told media outlets that her uncle was the one who had started the fire.\n\nAnne Buckingham said that Saffron wanted to purchase the park and hadn’t meant for anyone to die.\n\nSaffron had long been rumoured to be involved in the fire but had always denied he was responsible.\n\nJenny Poidevin, who lost her husband and two sons in the fire, said she had also heard different theories.\n\n“But I truly don’t know. I don’t know what to believe anymore.\n\n“To this day I still believe that there is someone out there that knows the exact truth and I don’t believe justice has been done in terms of what truly happened there that night.”\n\nAfter the fire the park was forced to close as people stayed away. Most of the park was demolished, and a new amusement park was constructed, which opened in 1982 under the name of Harbourside Amusement Park before resuming the Luna Park name.\n\nIn June 2015 Victoria Balch and Leah Washington both had to have a leg amputated after a car on The Smiler ride at Alton Towers collided with an empty one in front of it.\n\nDespite 16 people suffering injuries in the crash, the ride reopened again in April this year after the parent company Merlin said the accident was down to “human error” by staff who are being prosecuted under Health and Safety laws.\n\nSpeaking of the reopening, Balch said, “I can’t bear to think of the ride reopening. I hoped they would destroy it”.\n\nThree people died when the carriages on the world’s largest indoor triple loop roller coaster, The Mindbender, flew off the track.\n\nThe ride was described as one of the “safest rides in the world” when it was built reported The Express UK.\n\nBut in June 1986 missing bolts caused the four-car-train to fly from the track.\n\nThe last car collided with support structures before crashing into a concrete pillar in front of a packed audience watching a concert. Three people fell to their deaths and the fourth suffered serious neck and chest injuries.\n\nBut despite the tragedy the ride opened seven months later with new safety measures, and since then has had an excellent safety record reported The Mirror.\n\nA superman-themed ride at Darien Lake ended the life of an Iraq war veteran who had lost both his legs in the conflict reported The Express UK.\n\nJames Hackener, a US Army vet, was thrown from the Ride of Steel roller coaster and fell to his death in July 2011. It was later found that the safety barriers were not designed for amputees and he should never have been allowed on.\n\nIt was then revealed that a man was thrown from the same ride three days after the park first opened in 1999, but he was lucky enough to escape with only injuries. \n\nThe death of Hackener hasn’t turned people away from the theme park which remains open to this day. The actual ride is still in operation.\n\nThe infamous Action Park is known for being one of the most deadly theme parks ever built, as six people have died since its opening in 1978.\n\nThe first recorded death at the theme park was in July 1982, when a 15 year old drowned in the Tidal Wave Pool.\n\nThen in 1984, a 20 year old drowned and during the summer of 1987, an 18 year old died while in the pool.\n\nAfter three further deaths, caused by a drowning, an electrocution and a heart attack, the pool developed the name “Grave Pool”.\n\nThe park was forced to shut down in 1996 due to legal action over the deaths. It reopened under a new name in 1998 but reverted back to its original name in 2014.\n\nIn August 2016, Caleb Schwab, 10, was decapitated while riding on the 51 metre high Verruckt attraction at Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Kansas City, as horrified witnesses looked on.\n\nKansas City Police said Schwab suffered a “fatal neck injury at the end of the ride”.\n\nWitnesses claim Caleb went down the first drop of the world’s tallest waterside, then flew out and hit netting enclosing the ride.\n\nThe ride remained shut for rest of the summer season and details of the ride can no longer be found on the website. The park remained open however. There is no word yet on whether the ride will reopen next season.\n\nOn June 21, 2010, Gemma Savage, 20, died while riding on the Treetop Twister rollercoaster at the Lightwater Valley theme park in Yorkshire after a collision with two other cars.\n\nThe student suffered fatal head injuries and a damaged spine when her carriage accelerated up a U-bend, crashed into the car in front, before sliding back down and hitting the car behind.\n\nPark owners and ride manufacturers were fined a total of £155,000 (AU$247,993) after it was discovered wiring on the ride was faulty.\n\nThe ride eventually reopened under the slightly different name, Twister Ride.\n\nFourteen years after Savage’s death a worker was sacked for turning on the ride as a joke while a colleague was carrying out safety checks reported The Mirror.\n\nSasha Higgins was forced to cling on for life and scream out for help while she spun around in the waltzer style carriage. She was uninjured. \n\nIn April 2004 Hayley Williams, 16, was killed after she fell out of a car while riding on the Hydro water rollercoaster at Oakwood Theme Park.\n\nWilliams, who was visiting family in the area, fell 30 metres to the ground and died of internal injuries. The park was fined almost £250,000 (AU$400,00) for negligence after a report found employees weren’t regularly performing the correct safety checks.\n\nThe ride was closed for a year after William’s death and then reopened with the new name, Drenched.\n\n","standFirst":"HISTORY has shown us what happens to theme parks when things go horribly wrong. As Dreamworld looks to its future, here are how other venues responded to tragic accidents.\n\n","kicker":"Bust or boom","byline":"Gemma

Turnbull’s relationship with Tony Abbott is anyone’s guess really.\n\nFor his part, the Prime Minister maintains there is no feud.\n\n“Ofcourse not,” Mr Turnbull told 3AW Melbourne radio host Neil Mitchell this morning.\n\nPushed further, the PM kept his response diplomatic.\n\n“I have a cordial relationship with Tony Abbott as I do with all my colleagues in parliament.”\n\nHis comments come after Sky News yesterday obtained an unnamed Coalition MP’s talking points, which are titled “Abbott-Turnbull war”. \n\nThe document shows contradictory messages about the relationship between the Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott, who is the Member for Warringah. \n\nThe statement reads: “Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott are both working in the same direction of strengthening our democratic processes to open up opportunities for increased member participation.”\n\nThe MP went on to say there was “no sign of any conflict between their positions”, contradicting the title of the point. \n\nBut Opposition Leader Bill Shorten isn’t convinced. At a press conference yesterday, Mr Shorten said the Turnbull government was more interested in “fighting amongst each other” than it was in fighting for the jobs of Australians. \n\n“This is a government who will need more than spin to paper over the fundamental divisions in this government,” he told reporters.\n\n“The Turnbull government should be fighting for the jobs of Australians but they are more interested in fighting amongst each other about their own jobs, at a time when Medicare has been grievously cut, real wage levels are flatlining, wage rises are flatlining and living standards are falling — all we’ve got is a Liberal Government focused on fighting themselves, not standing up for Australians.”\n\nTensions between Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott have boiled over at several points during the past week.\n\nLast Thursday, both men flatly contradicted each other in Parliament over whether there was a deal to end a ban on a lever-action shotgun in return for a senator’s vote.\n\nMr Turnbull fired shots at his predecessor over the issue, accusing Mr Abbott of being fully aware of a “deal” to change gun laws in exchange for support Liberal Democrat David Leyonhjelm’s support in the Senate.\n\nBut Mr Abbott said the debate had not been represented fairly by Labor, accusing the Opposition of using “smoke screens” and “mirrors”.\n\n","standFirst":"THE

Khim Hang.\n\nThe fashion-loving Foreign Minister also met with Indonesian designers including Peggy Haranto and Restu Anggraini.\n\nThe self-described “friend of fashion” also mingled and took

industry adds $12 billion to Australia’s economy annually.\n\n“We are known for traditional industries like mining, resources and agriculture but it’s our creative industries that contribute about $90 billion to the Australian economy,” Ms Bishop said.\n\n“Through what I call fashion diplomacy ... we have been using our diplomatic resources around the world to connect Australian fashion designers with the fashion magazines, fashion houses and buyers around the world.\n\n“Australia and Indonesia are neighbours, we do co-operate and collaborate across a whole range of areas but I think one of

1991 murders of Margaret Penny, 58, and her hairdresser Claire Acocks, 49, inside a Portland hair salon are considered among Victoria’s most chilling killings.\n\nNow the families of both women hope evidence collected in the case against Mrs Penny’s husband Robert can finally solve the case at a second coronial inquest.\n\nRobert Penny, 84, was last year charged over the murders but died while his lawyers fought to have the case discontinued.\n\nMORE: Robert Penny dies waiting to face court\n\nShocking Portland murders remain unsolved\n\nNew evidence included statements from Mr Penny’s children and granddaughter police said were critical to finally solving the baffling murder mystery.\n\nIt also included a covertly recorded conversation shortly before Mr Penny’s arrest in which he talked about the murders and murder weapon.\n\nAn original inquest into the murder, held in 1995, concluded in an open finding.\n\nPolice interviewed 6000 people in relation to the killings.\n\nBoth the Penny and Acocks families requested a second inquest.\n\nPolice said evidence by Mr Penny’s estranged son was to be critical in the case against him.\n\nHe had also allegedly disclosed chilling detail to Mrs Acocks’ husband the morning after the murders.\n\nPolice said Mr Penny visited the Acocks’ family home and said: “Claire died very quickly. She was killed with a tail comb.”\n\nAt that time no one, including police, was aware of puncture marks or injuries.\n\nMr Penny’s son also told police his dad phoned him the night his mum was killed and told him what weapon was used.\n\nA similar call was allegedly made to his daughter.\n\nInvestigators believed Mr Penny was cheating on his wife with a woman he married shortly after his wife’s murder.\n\nOn the morning of the murders police believed the couple had an explosive fight over their granddaughter.\n\nMrs Penny had wanted to take the five-year-old to the hairdressers with her but police allege Mr Penny refused because “he knew what was to occur there later that day”.\n\nAhead of his death Mr Penny persistently denied any involvement in the killings.\n\n“This case has a long and complex history,” said coroner Jacqui Hawkins. \n\n“It’s most unfortunate that the criminal process was unable to be completed due to Mr Penny’s death.” \n\nThe inquest will begin on November 23.\n\nwith AAP\n\nshannon.deery@news.com.au\n\n@s_deery\n\n","standFirst":"A 25-year-old double murder mystery will be re-examined by the coroner after the man charged with the brutal killings died

outbreak has sparked a warning from public health authorities who predict a bumper season after recent floods and heavy rain provided perfect breeding grounds for the pests.\n\nThe biggest concern is the risk of Victorians contracting mosquito-borne diseases.\n\nWHY MOZZIES BITE SOME PEOPLE AND NOT OTHERS\n\nThe state’s chief health officer Charles Guest warned Victorians to be prepared and protect their families as experts on the ground predict “a serious problem” this summer.\n\nHave you encountered a swarm of mosquitoes lately? Tell us where below. \n\n“More than anything, mosquitoes are a nuisance. However, their bite can turn nasty for the few who get infected with a mosquito-borne disease,” Professor Guest said.\n\n“There are simple and inexpensive steps you can take to protect yourself and your loved ones.\n\n“Most importantly, people should ensure there are no pools of stagnant water on their property.”\n\nProfessor Guest said Victoria’s ‘Beat the Bite’ public awareness campaign, mosquito surveillance and control program had been brought forward a month early in response to increased reports of mosquito populations.\n\nFlood-affected areas in the Murray River region including Mildura, Swan Hill, Gannawarra, Campaspe, Moira, Wodonga and Shepparton are among those taking early action.\n\nMelbourne and its surrounding suburbs are also on the brink of a plague with residents reporting swarms of mosquitoes in recent days.\n\nA mosquito monitor is already working full time in some areas and parkland and open spaces with stagnant water are being sprayed with control agents.\n\nTraps have also been set up in breeding sites to count numbers and conduct tests to ensure the mozzies aren’t carrying deadly diseases.\n\nLast year, 301 cases of Ross River virus and 11 cases of Barmah Forest virus were reported across the state, with those affected suffering joint inflammation, pain and rash.\n\nMosquitoes can also carry the deadly Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVE) — an infection that can cause the brain to swell, leading to brain damage or death.\n\nThe last human case was detected was in 1974 but the virus has since been found in sentinel chicken flocks as part of the Victorian Government’s surveillance program. \n\n* Cover up. Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing when outdoors.\n\n* Use mosquito repellents containing DEET or picaridin on exposed skin.\n\n* Try to limit outdoor activity if lots of mosquitoes are about (usually dusk and dawn).\n\n* Make sure there is no stagnant water where mosquitoes can breed around your home by emptying flower pots, tyres, buckets, tins, bird baths and pet bowls weekly. \n\n* Empty children’s wading pools when not being used and keep fishponds stocked with fish.\n\nFor more health tips and advice, visit

dramatic footage shows the moment two officers opened fire on a man on Stud Rd, who had attempted to carjack a BMW moments earlier, while trying to escape police. \n\nFootage shows one of the policemen with his gun in his hand while chasing the 26-year-old. \n\nCameras also captured the moment the man fell to the ground after being shot.\n\nHe was arrested soon afterward.\n\nThe injured man was taken to Dandenong Hospital where he underwent surgery, after being shot just before 4pm past night.\n\nStud Rd was closed between Clow St and David St as a result.\n\nVictoria Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Hill said uniform police officers on patrol from Dandenong police station pulled over a car on Grey St, Dandenong, before a male driver ran off. \n\nThe police officers chased the man on foot, when the man pulled out a gun.\n\n“That foot chase continued through the back blocks, across fences, three garages of homes,” he said.\n\nMan wounded in police shooting\n\nMr Hill said the man — who was known to police — ran along Stud Rd before pointing a gun at the officers.\n\nBoth police officers, “who were in fear of their safety” shot the man.\n\nHe suffered two gunshot wounds to his torso.\n\nMr Hill said he had attended Dandenong police station and spoken to the pair\n\n“The two constables ... have done an exceptional job as far as I’m concerned, facing some very trying and challenging sets of circumstances, giving this individual ample opportunity to drop his weapon,” Mr Hill said.\n\n“But unfortunately they have had to resort to using their firearms in fear of their safety. \n\n“They have done an exceptional job in very trying circumstances as far as I’m concerned they acted with utmost professionalism; I’m quite proud of the work they’ve done.” \n\nIt was the second shooting in the Dandenong area yesterday.\n\nPolice were forced to fire shots at a woman who attempted to shoot them in Keysborough early this morning.\n\n","standFirst":"UPDATE: DRAMATIC footage shows the moment police twice shot an armed man trying to flee them in Melbourne’s southeast last night.\n\n","kicker":"Dandenong

has denounced as racist a cartoon by The Australian’s Bill Leak and invited complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act, which has happened.\n\nThis incitement to use the law to censor debate is appalling. But what of Triggs herself? Here are highlights of the case against her.\n\nTRIGGS last week admitted she’d misled Parliament by telling a Senate inquiry she’d been misquoted in a report that said she’d described Senators as “seriously ill-informed and uneducated”. When told her interview had been recorded, she admitted the report was accurate.\n\nTRIGGS also gave misleading evidence to a committee about what she claimed was an illegal “inducement” by the government to quit. It turned out to be the offer of a job the government claims she had herself suggested (which she denies).\n\nCOALITION GRILLS HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF OVER MISLEADING SENATE COMMITTEE EVIDENCE\n\nBLOG WITH BOLT\n\nMORE ANDREW BOLT\n\nMORE OPINION\n\nTRIGGS refused to hold an inquiry into children in detention while Labor was in power and filling our detention centres, but held one when the Liberals came into power and emptied them.\n\nTRIGGS gave a Senate committee three versions of whether she’d discussed with Labor her plan to delay the inquiry until after the 2010 poll — no, can’t remember and yes. \n\nTRIGGS falsely told her own inquiry that guards on Christmas Island were armed. \n\nTRIGGS told a Senate committee she was “shocked” at being pressured to resign by the Abbott government, when it seems she had asked the secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department how she stood with the government and was told the truth: it had lost confidence in her.\n\nTRIGGS claimed “almost all” children on Christmas Island “were coughing, were sick, were depressed, unable to communicate, weak”, which made her ask: “Why is this child not being treated?” False again. Most children were not sick and those that were were treated.\n\nTRIGGS falsely linked the execution by Indonesia of drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to the government’s border policies.\n\nTRIGGS has recommended record compensation, including $350,000 to a PNG “refugee” who’d beaten his Australian wife to death with a bicycle. \n\nSo why is Triggs still there?\n\nBLOG WITH BOLT\n\nMORE ANDREW BOLT\n\nMORE OPINION\n\n","standFirst":"GILLIAN Triggs’ failure to defend one of our most critical rights, free speech, means there is no alternative but for her to resign, writes Andrew Bolt.\n\n","kicker":"No alternative","byline":"Andrew Bolt","commentsAllowed":true,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":true,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["Andrew Bolt"],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":[]},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":{"value":"1d5956e957ee20e9c4bdb533cdedc6cf","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/content/v2/1d5956e957ee20e9c4bdb533cdedc6cf"},"originId":"c1863f4a-9b05-11e6-a6cc-8bf57620ea71","origin":"METHODE","channel":"NONE","title":"Did Pixar film star in VCE English exam?","subtitle":"VCE English exam students draw comparison to 2006 Pixar film Cars in exam newspaper analysis section","description":"IT was meant to elicit serious analysis, but today’s VCE English exam took many students on an unexpected ride to a kid’s film favourite.\n\n","link":"http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/1d5956e957ee20e9c4bdb533cdedc6cf?domain=heraldsun.com.au","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","originalSource":"Herald Sun","creditedSource":"Herald Sun","subscriptionSummary":"IT was meant to elicit serious analysis, but today’s VCE English exam took many students on an unexpected ride to a kid’s film favourite.","originalAssetId":"c1863f4a-9b05-11e6-a6cc-8bf57620ea71","version":"PUBLISHED","dateUpdated":"2016-10-26T06:33:04.000Z","dateLive":"2016-10-26T05:18:00.000Z","customDate":"2016-10-26T06:32:00.000Z","dateCreated":"2016-10-25T22:52:50.000Z","status":"ACTIVE","thumbnailImage":{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":{"value":"b9f3547604c12663c86eba84fabb3ea4","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b9f3547604c12663c86eba84fabb3ea4"},"originId":"fe26c16a-9b3a-11e6-ab69-22cb8f6501a3","origin":"METHODE","title":"Did Pixar film star in VCE English exam?","subtitle":"fe26c16a-9b3a-11e6-ab69-22cb8f6501a3","description":"Did Pixar film star in VCE English exam?","link":"http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/thumbnail/b9f3547604c12663c86eba84fabb3ea4","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","originalSource":"News Limited","version":"PUBLISHED","dateUpdated":"2016-10-26T06:32:28.000Z","dateLive":"2016-10-26T05:18:00.000Z","dateCreated":"2016-10-26T05:13:55.000Z","status":"ACTIVE","related":[],"domainLinks":[],"categories":[],"keywords":["wide assortment","high octane","cars","Pictured","Picture","winner","Academy Award","right","SUPPLIED","film","Walt Disney Pictures","feature","adventure","features","animated","Mater","characters","released","scene","seventh","comedy","Route","kicks","get","assortment","octane","wide","mcqueen","Pixar Animation Studios","John Lasseter"],"authors":[],"domains":["heraldsun.com.au","cairnspost.com.au","ntnews.com.au","couriermail.com.au","themercury.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","news.com.au","townsvillebulletin.com.au","perthnow.com.au","dailytelegraph.com.au","geelongadvertiser.com.au"],"locationGeoPoints":[],"urlTitle":"fe26c16a9b3a11e6ab6922cb8f6501a3","format":"jpeg","width":100,"height":75,"imageName":"Pictured left to right: Mater and McQueen in a scene from CARS, the seventh animated feature to be created by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures, is a high octane adventure comedy that features a wide assortment of cars as characters who get their kicks on Route 66.

students have drawn comparisons with the animated movie Cars and a newspaper column presented in the final section of the exam — both based on backwater towns bypassed by a freeway.\n\nPupils were asked to analyse how language and pictures were used in the story, about a sleepy town called Lawton, to persuade readers to a particular point of view.\n\nA picture from the 2006 Pixar film posted to a Facebook VCE page drew a big reaction, with the similarities providing some light relief in pressure-cooker exam rooms around Victoria.\n\n“First thing I thought of when I read it,” one student wrote.\n\n“OMG yes I was thinking of this the whole time,” posted another.\n\nAnother said: “The disappointment was real when they didn’t refer to it though”.\n\nTeens also poked fun at the giant watermelon featuring in the accompanying cartoon.\n\nNostalgia aside, there were tears and cheers after the first main VCE exam today, sat by more than 43,000 students across the state.\n\nAt Mount Waverley Secondary College, they were treated to ice blocks as they walked out of the exam room.\n\nCaleb Benson, 18, said the time he invested in practice exams paid off.\n\n“It was what I expected, I feel pretty confident,” he said.\n\nFellow student Peter Cambouris, 18, felt there were no surprises.\n\n“It was a bit daunting, a bit confronting,” he said.\n\n“I’m anxious to find out what I got.”\n\nVictorian Association for the Teaching of English president Melissa Goffin described the exam as “business as usual”, with only minor sources of debate.\n\n“Myself and others felt the premise and message of the cartoon was unclear,” she said. \n\n“But it may not be absolutely clear to anyone, and it was an opportunity for a student to present what they believes was the argument of the cartoonist and substantiate that through analysis.”\n\n","standFirst":"IT was meant to elicit serious analysis, but today’s VCE English exam took many students on an unexpected ride to a kid’s film favourite.\n\n","kicker":"Nostalgic flashback","byline":"Elissa Doherty","commentsAllowed":true,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":true,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["Elissa

theme park issued a statement this afternoon declaring the re-opening of the park as a “Memorial Day”.\n\n“We hope this will be considered the start of the healing process for all concerned,” the statement reads.\n\n“The park will open at 11am and entry proceeds from the day will go to the Australian Red Cross to support their continued community focused activies.\n\n“From the Memorial Day, activities will be limited to smaller rides, animal attractions, and the water park.”\n\nHundreds of Queenslanders have visited Dreamworld to pay their respects to the victims of the theme park tragedy.\n\nMore than 500 bouquets of flowers were piled at the park’s entrance throughout the day and an evening candlelight vigil attracted large crowds of mourners.\n\nEARLIER: Police have taken some 40 witness statements from the people at the scene of yesterday’s horrific death ride at Dreamworld and are appealing for more to come forward.\n\nAddressing the media Wednesday afternoon, Detective Inspector Mark Thompson from Gold Coast CIB said anyone who saw the tragedy or took mobile phone footage may be able to help the investigation.\n\nHe also dismissed reports the phone and wallet of Kate Goodchild’s partner was stolen as he frantically tried to save her.\n\nDetective Inspector Thompson would not comment on reports the ride was shut down twice yesterday for technical faults prior to yesterday’s catastrophic accident.\n\nHe said that was a subject to be covered in the coronial investigation.\n\nDreamworld CEO Craig Davidson led dozens of staff laying wreaths outside the theme park.\n\nSome hugged eachother for support before returning inside the theme park. \n\nIn a brief statement, Mr Davidson said the entire Dreamworld family was hurting and he pledged “full support” for the two young children who survived the tragedy.\n\n“I want to specifically acknowledge the impact on the two children who were involved in this tragedy,” he said.\n\n“These children will have our full support in to the future.\n\n“The Dreamworld team is absolutely committed to supporting the authorities investigating the incident so we can find out exactly what has occurred.”\n\n","standFirst":"DREAMWORLD will reopen its gates to the public just three days after Tuesday’s tragedy in which four people died as a candlelight vigil attracted large crowds of mourners.\n\n","kicker":"Help wanted","byline":"Jeremy Pierce","commentsAllowed":true,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":true,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["Jeremy

O’Meara trade: Fans react with #FreePickHawthorn hashtag","userOriginUpdated":"patona","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Fans-react-to-revelations-of-botched-Jaeger-OMeara-trade","revision":3,"body":"The Herald Sun revealed this morning that the AFL had interpreted its own rules on trading future draft picks, allowing the O’Meara deal to go through in the final minutes of the trade period.\n\nThe league said on Wednesday that nothing illegal had taken place based on “the full wording of the rule”. \n\nBut spokesman Patrick Keane replied to a fan’s question six hours after the trade deadline saying the Hawks weren’t allowed to trade their own 2017 second-round pick to Gold Coast — the deal the league now says was within the rules.\n\nEarlier this year the hashtag #freekickhawthorn became a viral online campaign after the Hawks won several close games that involved controversial umpiring calls.\n\nNow it has a post-season counterpart.\n\nSam Landsberger’s exclusive article has attracted more than 200 comments so far and hundreds more on Facebook. A high percentage are a variation of “free kick Hawthorn”, but others show Hawk fans jumping to their team’s defence.\n\n“I love the jealous tears of other supporters ... can almost taste them,” wrote Drty Dan.\n\nPeter added: “Obviously a LOT of people very scared of the Mighty Hawks! Suck it up, we intend to be right back there next year.”\n\nOpposition supporters also railed against deals Hawthorn did with St Kilda and Carlton that paved the way for the O’Meara trade, with several pointing out AFL football operations boss Mark Evans’ previous job was at the Hawks.\n\nNeil has demanded action: “Heads must roll at AFL House and the O’Meara deal must be voided. #FreeKick Hawthorn”\n\nRip has a plan for action: “A Royal Commission should be formed to investigate AFL favouritism ... I think the head of ASADA should be chairman for a speedy result!”\n\nAlan perhaps summed it up best: “I am sitting here with a friend who has studied quantum physics and we have no idea what the draft rules mean! I suspect no one at the AFL does either.” \n\n","standFirst":"HAWTHORN created a social media storm during the season over allegedly favourable umpiring.

Angeles County District Attorney’s Office announced today that 29-year-old Shaun Anthony Haywood was charged with attempted murder, aggravated mayhem and assault with a deadly weapon. \n\nHaywood, who is known as Esra, is accused of entering Kerr’s property in Malibu, California on October 14 and slashing a guard’s face with his own knife. The guard shot Haywood four times during the confrontation.\n\nHaywood, from Brisbane, allegedly broke into Kerr’s home in Malibu on October 14 to deliver a letter to the supermodel, prosecutors said. Once inside, he was confronted by a security guard, KTLA reported. \n\nTMZ reported that Kerr’s neighbour said workers on the deck of his home witnessed the altercation. They said Haywood jumped the fence onto Miranda’s property, and that’s when the security guard approached him. They reported that he didn’t obey requests to get on the ground, and attacked the guard with a knife. They wrestled on the ground before separating, but when the man charged the guard again he opened fire. \n\nTMZ reported that haywood was shot 4 times — 2 in the chest area and 2 in the shoulder. \n\n911 was called during the fight.\n\nThe Brisbane man, who faces up to life in prison if convicted, is scheduled to appear in court later today. Efforts to find a lawyer for Haywood were unsuccessful at time of publication. \n\nKerr, who lives with her five-year-old son Flynn at the home, was not inside at the time of the incident.\n\nIt was the second time in a week that police had been to Kerr’s mansion responding to a report of an intruder.\n\nKerr announced her engagement to billionaire Snapchat co-founder/CEO Evan Spiegel in July. \n\nShe married English actor Orlando Bloom in 2010 before announcing their separation in October 2013. Flynn was born in 2011.\n\n","standFirst":"WARNING: GRAPHIC.

Buckenara North Melbourne list analysis: Rebuild to win a premiership, Brent Boomer Harvey should be playing","userOriginUpdated":"patona","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Gary-Buckenara-analyses-North-Melbournes-list-after-2016-season","revision":8,"body":"Their injuries this year showed a lack of depth on the list. They went from winning nine in a row at the start of the season to falling over the line and being the weakest team in the finals series. \n\nTo put it bluntly: If North Melbourne wants to win a premiership, it must completely rebuild the list.\n\nThe Kangaroos have been a middle-tier club worried about bottoming out but it seems as though, with the decisions made on those well-respected greats, they might be ready to go down that path. They’ve finally understood it and accepted it, which is a very hard thing to do for a middle of the road club that relies on being competitive every year to sell memberships and sponsorship etc.\n\nFrom my experience, I have no doubt from board level through to the football department they’re in a period where they’re thinking: We’ve played finals, been close to a Grand Final, can we capitalise on this momentum? We might not have a list good enough to win a flag but let’s continue to play finals and gain that support and build our membership to keep the money rolling in with sponsorship dollars as well. That all comes as a result of playing finals.\n\nBut at the end of the day, all football clubs exist to win premierships. That’s the ultimate goal.\n\nIf the ultimate goal is just to play finals then to me that defeats the purpose of why you’re all there. You need to strive for the excellence required to achieve the ultimate success. \n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE HAWKS\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE TIGERS\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE BLUES\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE PIES\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE CATS\n\nAs list managers it’s our job to know whether the list is good enough to win a premiership and if not, what decisions are we going to make that will see us become a better team going forward? Have we got the patience and the resolve to rebuild through the draft and go through some hard years in terms of on-field performance and results for a long-term benefit? \n\nThe time is now to find out if these young kids can play at the level. For too long North Melbourne has topped up with players from other clubs and not exposed these draftees to senior footy. They must do that now.\n\nI’m thinking of guys like Sam Durdin, Ben McKay, Corey Wagner, Declan Mountford and Ed Vickers-Willis. I do have my question marks on Durdin though, with his competitiveness and his football smarts.\n\nBrad Scott needs to play them to find out if they’re players for the future and the ones who’ll be key parts of the rebuild. That’s all part of rebuilding the list.\n\nHaving said that, you still need experience around the club while rebuilding and that’s why I was really puzzled about the decision to axe Brent Harvey. He hadn’t lost his pace and was clearly still one of their best players, someone who has star power. And to a lesser extent Nick Dal Santo as well, I thought both of those had something to offer in 2017.\n\nThe Kangaroos made the right decision on Drew Petrie though. To me at the end of the year he looked cooked, whereas Harvey and Dal Santo didn’t. Firrito was a bit of a line ball call, probably the right one.\n\nBut the list is in trouble.\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE DOCKERS\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE EAGLES\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE DEMONS\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE SAINTS\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE GIANTS\n\nI was worried both last year and this year because I’ve felt the Kangaroos were one or two injuries — particularly to Goldstein — away from their side being severely disrupted and unfortunately for Scott and the club’s supporters, that’s exactly what happened. \n\nIt was no coincidence when Goldstein was playing injured and then missed a game, their form dramatically dropped away. That’s a major concern.\n\nTodd Goldstein is North Melbourne’s barometer. If he plays well, the Kangaroos win. If he’s struggling, then the whole team goes down with him. \n\nMajak Daw has committed to the club and the club has committed to him but is he the answer? Will he or is he capable of becoming that huge influence like Goldstein? \n\nI look at the list and try to find another ruckman and really, Daw is it. Petrie helped out in that area but now he’s obviously gone and Ben Brown has done some of that work but they’ll need him to be a stay-at-home key forward because there is a lack of key position players.\n\nThe biggest concerns I have — even though they’ve lost a lot of experience with Petrie, Harvey, Firrito, Dal Santo and now Daniel Wells leaving will bring down their average age — if I go through the young players on the list I’m not sure how good they are. Which players will be their next stars and take the places of the departing champions?\n\nI’m left scratching my head a little bit when I do look down the list for these guys.\n\nWhile there is some talent there, I just don’t see enough good players.\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE CROWS\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE BOMBERS\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE LIONS\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE SUNS\n\nLIST ANALYSIS: BUCKENARA ON THE POWER\n\nJed Anderson is going to be a good player — he was a bit of a whipping boy this year but his body hasn’t been right for a while. But at least he played some footy this year so he’ll be better for that, he’ll be better next year. \n\nI like Ben Jacobs as a player, Ben Cunnington has developed into a really good player, young McKay has some talent as has Durdin but will that talent come to the fore? As I wrote earlier I’ve got some question marks on him and I’m concerned that even though North will need he and McKay to step up next year, I’m not sure they’re ready in terms of their development. \n\nDaniel Nielson was unlucky doing his knee but he’s not going to be a match-winner, he’ll be a depth player. Taylor Garner is a handy player, Ryan Clarke has some upside, Trent Dumont has shown some signs, Shaun Atley and Sam Wright and developing nicely into good regular 22 players, Luke McDonald was in and out and still finding his feet.\n\nMason Wood has potential, Jamie Macmillan had a good year, Kayne Turner is a bit injury-prone, Sam Gibson and Ben Brown have been serviceable.\n\nBut when you go through the list, they’re all nice players and depth players but are they going to win you a premiership?\n\nThey’re lacking star power. And that’s why they rely so heavily on Goldstein. \n\nThe Kangaroos recruited three players during the trade period and I like what they’ve done. Basically all three have joined for little in terms of trade deals and have cost North Melbourne in salary cap only.\n\nNathan Hrovat from the Bulldogs is an in and under player who couldn’t break into what turned out to be the premiership team despite solid VFL form. I liked him as an under 18s player so he could be a good addition.\n\nMarley Williams arrived the cheapest, which leads me to question whether he may have been pushed out by the Pies? But Williams is like Hrovat in that he’s a player they desperately need given he adds pace. But while he’s handy, he isn’t a star and both are small/mid-sized players rather than key position which is a critical need at the Kangaroos. Williams also isn’t is a great kick either.\n\nPaul Ahern from GWS is again a mid-sized player who can play both forward and in the midfield. He has some real talent but two knee reconstructions is a concern. Hopefully he has a change in luck at Arden St.\n\nWHAT THEY NEED\n\nNorth Melbourne definitely needs players with height and a back-up ruckman to Goldstein is the first port of call. I don’t think Daw is a ruckman, he doesn’t read the play well enough around the ground. If something happens to Goldstein and he’s their No.1 ruckman, then North Melbourne is in strife. They also need at least another key forward and key defender plus more outside pace. More generally, the Kangaroos need players who use the ball well. \n\nI think there are too many players with average kicks on the list — even some of their better players like Andrew Swallow isn’t a great kick and neither is Cunnington or Jacobs. Jack Ziebell is a great kick and so is Shaun Higgins, while Atley is OK and so is Wright but McDonald isn’t a pinpoint kick. Players with good kicks coming off halfback is a particular need because when they look inside and are required to hit targets in the midfield, they need to do so in the modern game 9/10 times not 6/10. North Melbourne doesn’t have that and that’s why they struggle. It hurts them.\n\nWHO’S UNDER THE PUMP\n\nThe Kangaroos have re-signed Daw so now he’s got to step up. He’s wanted the opportunities and now he’s going to get them so it’s time to deliver. No more “what if” or “I’d be in if Petrie or whoever wasn’t there”, there are no more excuses.\n\nIt shows me that there is such a lack of talls in the AFL landscape that other clubs were actually interested in trying to get Daw out of North Melbourne. He can do some brilliant things but he just doesn’t do them enough, he’s so inconsistent. But at the end of the day that’s probably why he survives, because he can do freakish things. \n\nAaron Mullett is one that’s been around a while but where is he going as a player? He’s had some injuries but even when fit hasn’t been a regular since he had that breakout season a few years back.\n\nEd Vickers-Willis hasn’t broken through so he’ll be needing to show a bit next year, particularly given it’s looking like more young kids will get their chance at senior level. He needs to be one of those.\n\nWHO SHOULD GO\n\nBrent Harvey, Drew Petrie, Nick Dal Santo, Michael Firrito, Robin Nahas, Brad McKenzie and Joel Tippett have all been delisted and Farren Ray has retired, while Wells has departed as a free agent and I think Mullett would be one to be moved on. The rest of the players just haven’t had exposure at senior level and they deserve a chance. \n\nCRYSTAL BALL\n\nI worry about North Melbourne. They could go from top eight to a bottom six club. It wouldn’t surprise me, if they do go down the full rebuild path, that they end up finishing really low on the ladder because there just isn’t a huge amount of quality coming through, nor have the young guys been exposed at all at senior level. They’ll be thrown right into the deep end. \n\n","standFirst":"NORTH Melbourne must rebuild if it wants to win a premiership but there are major question marks on the club’s young players.

office confirmed he has been voluntarily interviewed by Victorian detectives who flew to Rome last week.\n\n“The Cardinal repeats his previous rejection of all and every allegation of sexual abuse and will continue to co-operate with Victoria Police until the investigation is finalised,” a statement from Cardinal Pell’s office in Rome said.\n\n“The Cardinal has no further comment at this time.”\n\nIt was the first time the sex allegations made against Cardinal Pell have been put directly to him.\n\n“Three members of Victoria Police travelled to Rome last week where Cardinal George Pell voluntarily participated in an interview regarding allegations of sexual assault,” Victoria Police spokeswoman Leonie Johnson said today.\n\nRELATED: Andrew Bolt interviews George Pell\n\nBOLT: Pell victim of vicious witch hunt\n\n“As a result of the interview, further investigations are continuing.\n\n“We are not prepared to comment further at this time.”\n\nThe Herald Sun revealed in June that Victoria’s top cop was prepared to send detectives to Italy to interview Cardinal Pell about the sex abuse claims.\n\nChief Commissioner Graham Ashton was reluctant to talk about the Cardinal Pell probe during a wideranging interview with the Herald Sun to mark his first year in the job.\n\n“We don’t give running commentary on ongoing investigations,” he said in June.\n\nBut comments Mr Ashton made when pressed by the Herald Sun confirmed Sano taskforce detectives are investigating multiple sexual abuse allegations made against Cardinal Pell.\n\nThe Herald Sun asked Mr Ashton if the Cardinal Pell investigation might result in Sano sex crime specialists being sent to the Vatican to speak to Cardinal Pell if he didn’t return to Australia.\n\n“If that became necessary then of course we would,” Mr Ashton said.\n\n“But it has not been put as necessary to me at this point in time.”\n\nThe Herald Sun revealed in February that Victoria Police’s Sano taskforce is investigating allegations that Cardinal Pell sexually abused up to 10 boys between 1978 and 2001 during his time as a priest in Ballarat and when he was archbishop of Melbourne.\n\nFollowing that exclusive report, Cardinal Pell wrote to the then acting Police Minister Robin Scott requesting an investigation into how the details became public.\n\nMr Ashton then referred the matter to Victoria’s Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission.\n\nAsked by the Herald Sun in June if it was correct that the IBAC probe doesn’t stop the Sano taskforce investigation from continuing as both investigations are being run separately, Mr Ashton said: “Yes, exactly.”\n\nCardinal Pell, 75, has denied the allegations, saying in a statement they were “without foundation and utterly false”.\n\nThe Herald Sun is not suggesting Cardinal Pell is guilty of the allegations, only that they are being investigated.\n\nMr Ashton defended the decision to investigate the child sexual abuse allegations made against Cardinal Pell.\n\n“You can imagine if we didn’t you would rightly be accused of some sort of cover up,” he told the Herald Sun in June.\n\n“We have always got to treat these matters the same, regardless of who is the person complained of.”\n\nThe elite Sano taskforce was established in November 2012 to investigate historic and new allegations that emanated from the Victorian Parliamentary Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and Other Non-Government Organisations.\n\nBased within Victoria Police’s crime department, Sano is comprised of specialist sexual assault detectives who use modern methods to identify links between offenders and offences.\n\nIt is also co-ordinating investigations emerging from the Australian Government Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.\n\nWhile Cardinal Pell gave evidence before the child abuse royal commission from Rome in March, he wasn’t questioned about the specific allegations made to the Sano taskforce.\n\nSano detectives revealed in December 2015 they were investigation allegations of sexual assault against boys as young as 14 at St Patrick’s Cathedral in East Melbourne between 1996 and 2001.\n\nCardinal Pell — who is effectively in charge of Vatican finances and is now the third most senior Catholic in the world — was Melbourne’s archbishop between 1996 and 2001.\n\nSano detectives involved in the St Patrick’s investigation appealed for public help in December last year.\n\n“Detectives would like to speak to anyone who was a victim of a sexual assault, or anybody with information relating to any alleged sexual assaults, committed at the St Patrick’s Cathedral between 1996 and 2001,” Victoria Police spokeswoman Sharon Darcy said at the time.\n\n“Victoria Police is committed to investigating and bringing to justice people who prey on children no matter how many years have passed.”\n\nmark.buttler@heraldsun.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"CARDINAL George Pell has vowed to cooperate with Victoria Police in its ongoing probe into child sex abuse allegations made against

was the Cubs’ first win in a World Series game since 1945.\n\nDazzling Cy Young winner Arrieta used his repertoire of fastballs, cutters, sinkers and sliders to baffle the Indians as he threw 5-1/3 innings of no-hit ball before Jason Kipnis doubled with one out in the sixth.\n\nArrieta and two relievers combined on a four-hitter on a chilly night on the shores of Lake Erie that ended with a cold rain falling as the Cubs achieved a split of the opening two games in Cleveland before the next three are played in Chicago. \n\nAnthony Rizzo, Ben Zobrist and Kyle Schwarber, the numbers three through five hitters in Chicago’s line-up, combined for five hits, four runs scored and four runs batted in after the hard-hitting Cubs were shut-out 6-0 in Game 1.\n\nWith the Fall Classic shifting to Wrigley Field, the Cubs on Friday (Saturday AEDT) will host their first World Series game in 71 years with Kyle Hendricks taking the mound against Cleveland’s Josh Tomlin.\n\nThe Cubs are attempting to win a first World Series since 1908 and end the longest title drought in American sports while the Indians have not won it since 1948.\n\n2016 WORLD SERIES SCHEDULE (AEDT)\n\nGame 3: 11am Saturday, October 29 (Wrigley Field, Chicago)\n\nGame 4: 11am Sunday, October 30 (Wrigley Field, Chicago)\n\nGame 5: 11am Monday, October 31 (Wrigley Field, Chicago)\n\nGame 6: 11am Wednesday, November 2 (Progressive Field, Cleveland)*\n\nGame 7: 11am Thursday, November 3 (Progressive Field, Cleveland)*\n\n* if required\n\nThe World Series will be broadcast live on ESPN in Australia.

a bold break with tradition, the AFL has agreed to stage a match on the first day of Easter, but only after assurances that the match would be focused on “doing it for the kids.”\n\nThe Kangaroos, who have lobbied to play on Good Friday for almost 30 years, and this year’s premiers, the Western Bulldogs, were officially informed today by the AFL they had beaten a field of other contenders to stage the 4.20pm game on April 14 next year.\n\nAFL general manager of clubs and operations Travis Auld confirmed the decision, saying the league believed the game could prove a serious benefit to the Good Friday Appeal, while insisting the timeslot was aimed at allowing people to observe the religious significance of the day, if they desired.\n\nMORE: Kangaroos to play historic match, Bulldogs likely\n\nThe 2016 draft order for every club\n\n“The AFL Commission made a decision a few years ago that they would be prepared for a game to be played on Good Friday,” Auld said. \n\n“They elected not to do that the last couple of season because they just couldn’t find the right opportunity, as Easter was Round 1.”\n\n“This year Easter is Round 4 and we think it gives us an opportunity to schedule a game on Good Friday. In saying that, we want to be really clear that the game supports a number of activities planned for that day.\n\n“First, we have the Good Friday Appeal in Melbourne, which is an iconic event, and we had to be convinced, and we had to convince our partners that we could contribute and add value to that. We also had to be mindful and respectful of the religious services that take place on the day, hence the game being fixtured at 4.20pm.”\n\nIt is understood the AFL also alerted the clubs who missed out after lodging submissions, believed to be Carlton and St Kilda.\n\n“This is not confirmed as an ongoing fixture slot for them (North Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs),” Auld said.\n\n“We will look at both clubs that compete in this game, but we might move it around the country as we go forward. Some of that will be dependent on its success to the Good Friday Appeal, and how teams are performing and what is the best slot.”\n\nGood Friday Appeal director Anne Randal supported the initiative.\n\n“Football and the Good Friday Appeal are both deeply loved institutions in Victoria and the coming together provides a fantastic opportunity to raise much needed funds for our great hospital,’’ she said. \n\n“The Good Friday Appeal is excited to be working with the AFL, North Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs, Channel 7 and the Herald Sun to make the most of this opportunity.’’\n\nNorth Melbourne chief executive Carl Dilena said his club was “absolutely thrilled” with the decision, saying they had already been in contact with the Bulldogs to discuss ways in which the Good Friday Appeal could be further supported.\n\n“It’s a tribute to this club’s track record of innovation and a credit to all the great North people like Bob Ansett, Ron Casey and Greg Miller, who initially proposed this game in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s,” Dilena said.\n\n“While we have a game to win, there’s also going to be a lot of cohesion between the clubs and the AFL as we work with the Appeal organisers, the Herald and Weekly Times, and Channel 7, to ensure there’s a good synergy between the two major events.\n\n“We’ve always had a great relationship with the Royal Children’s Hospital, as virtual neighbours, and look forward to helping make this day even greater.”\n\nBulldogs chief executive Gary Kent said it was “a terrific result” for his club to be involved in such an important event.\n\n“We are looking forward to putting on a great spectacle for all fans, but we also want to ensure the match enhances the Good Friday Appeal and the Royal Children’s Hospital’s fundraising efforts,” Kent said.\n\nThe Good Friday Appeal this year, which is run by the Herald and Weekly Times, raised more than $17.4 million, with the expectation that the game at Etihad Stadium could provide an even bigger windfall next year.\n\nFormer North Melbourne chairman Bob Ansett, one of the pioneers of the push for Good Friday football in the 1980s, said: “I’d be surprised if Etihad Stadium wasn’t packed to the rafters. \n\nIt’s taken a while to come to fruition but it was our idea and it’s great to see we’ve been recognised as pioneers yet again.”\n\nglenn.mcfarlane@news.com.au\n\n@MaccaHeraldSun\n\n","standFirst":"NORTH Melbourne and Western Bulldogs will meet in a historic Good Friday twilight encounter at Eithad Stadium next year,

Michael Croucher freed Aydin Hamit, 18, on conditions that he abide by an early curfew and report to police daily in a lineball decision after hearing of the teen’s alleged crime spree.\n\nThe court heard yesterday Hamit’s mother picked up her teenage son and his ­accomplices while they were being pursued by police.\n\nIt’s alleged police saw Hamit arrive home in Chadstone in his mother’s car minutes after dumping a stolen vehicle.\n\nHis barrister, Gideon Boas, aired police claims that Mr Hamit’s mother was in contact with his companions around the time the police air wing lost sight of the Holden Commodore.\n\n“There’s a suggestion she might have provided some ­assistance by way of facilitation of the commission of the crime,” Mr Boas said during yesterday’s bail application.\n\nJustice Croucher, who reserved his decision overnight, said he was swayed “by a fairly slim margin” after taking into account Mr Hamit’s youth and the delay in proceedings.\n\nMr Hamit’s stepfather, Bertie Arlove, offered to accommodate the teen at his home and put up a $10,000 surety.\n\nJustice Croucher said the strength of the police case was also a consideration.\n\n“It’s obvious that ... it’s not a watertight case,” he said.\n\nHe agreed Mr Hamit could further offend but said the risk had to be weighed against other factors.\n\nThe teen has been charged over a series of smash-and-grabs on northern suburbs shopping centres that ended in a CBD carjacking and police chase on June 2.\n\nActing Sergeant Stephanie Attard said the gang of five forced its way into three shopping centres, stealing $18,000 worth of cigarettes.\n\nIt’s alleged Mahmoud Taha, accused of organising jewellery store robberies carried out by Apex gang members, was part of the crew carrying out the commercial burglaries.\n\nJust after 3am police deployed “stop sticks” in Ascot Vale, disabling a Mercedes.\n\nSgt Attard said the occupants of a second car picked up the driver and they continued to Collins St in the city, where Mr Hamit and others stole the Commodore.\n\n“It’s alleged the accused was in possession of a sledge­hammer at the time and demanded the victim get out of the vehicle,” she said.\n\nMr Hamit was behind the wheel of the Commodore when it went through a red light and smashed into a taxi at a Spencer St intersection about 3.30am, the court heard.\n\nThe air wing tracked the Commodore to Glen Iris, losing sight of it at 3.53am.\n\nSgt Attard said police conducting a check on Mr Hamit’s home saw him and a companion arrive as passengers in his mother’s vehicle at 4.10am.\n\n“The accused’s mother was in contact with all of the ­co-accused.\n\n“Police allege all of these phone calls were made to ­locate where her (son was),” Sgt Attard said.\n\nMr Hamit is set to reappear at Melbourne Magistrates’ Court on January 31.\n\nangus.thompson@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"A SUPREME Court judge has bailed an accused sledgehammer-wielding carjacker

ride deaths: Four reportedly dead after incident","userOriginUpdated":"randelle","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Emergency-crews-respond-to-incident-at-Dreamworld","revision":48,"body":"Two men and two women died at Dreamworld when the family favourite Thunder River Rapids ride apparently malfunctioned on Tuesday afternoon. \n\nThe exact circumstances of the accident are under investigation but the six- person raft the victims were on flipped over while travelling on a conveyor belt. \n\nTwo of the victims were flung clear of the raft into the water, while the other two were trapped under the raft.\n\nThe tragedy left the city stunned, rocking its image as a destination for fun- filled family holidays.\n\n“It’s one of the saddest days in our city,” Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate told AAP. “The Gold Coast is renowned for people to come here and have wonderful memories for the rest of their lives. \n\n“This is the reverse of that. A tragedy like this, it affects us deeply because we cherish making sure we look after our visitors.\n\n“It is the most emotional day we’ve had.” Police wouldn’t release the identities of the victims, but said they were a 32 -year-old and 42-year-old women, and 38-year-old and 35-year-old men. It is believed that at least two of those killed are related, and other media reports have claimed some or all of the victims were on holiday from Canberra. Police were in the process of notifying the victim’s families early on Tuesday night, and were talking to witnesses at nearby police stations as the bodies began to be recovered at the park. \n\n“It is a complex retrieval involving heavy equipment and that will take several hours,” Inspector Tod Reid said.\n\nFootage of the incident has also been captured on CCTV cameras. “That will be reviewed as part of the investigation,” Inspector Reid said. One witness described consoling a young girl at the scene in the aftermath of the accident, who she fears was related to at least one of those killed. “We saw a little girl screaming for her mum ... it was horrible,” Lia Capes told Seven News. \n\n“It was so scary.\n\n“We tried to comfort her to the side to distract her.” Several parkgoers claimed the ride had broken down at least twice earlier in the day and police said those claims would form part of the investigation. “I’m not aware (of earlier problems on the ride) but that will obviously be part of the investigation,” Inspector Reid said. \n\nQueensland Ambulance senior operating officer Gavin Fuller said park staff had attempted first aid on the victims but their injuries were just too severe for them to be saved. \n\n“One of the rides have sustained some sort of malfunction,” Mr Fuller said. “A number of the staff that were here today from Queensland Ambulance have been deeply affected by this terrible accident that has occurred today.” Dreamworld was closed down and evacuated an hour after the accident occurred at approximately 2.20pm. \n\nThe park will remain shut on Wednesday as Workplace Health and Safety Officials and police forensic crash investigators try to discover just how the incident happened, and it’s unknown when it will reopen. \n\nPark owner Ardent Leisure shares fell 7.8 per cent after the accident. The Thunder River Rapids Ride is currently Australia’s only river rapids ride and opened in December 1986. \n\nDreamworld’s Rocky Hollow Log Ride was shut down in April this year when a man fell from the ride and nearly drowned.\n\n","standFirst":"UPDATE: Four adults – two women, aged 42 and 32, and two men, aged 38 and 35 – have died after becoming trapped when a raft flipped on a family ride at Dreamworld. The tragedy has been labelled one of the saddest days in the Gold Coast’s history. \n\n","kicker":"Horrific scene","byline":"Trenton Akers, David Murray, Jeremy Pierce, Jessica Marszalek, Thomas

changes","userOriginUpdated":"banksa","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"James-Brayshaw-gone-from-Channel-9-cricket-commentary-team","revision":7,"body":"The Nine Network has announced its cricket broadcast schedule for this summer and confirmed former Aussie Test captain Michael Clarke and former English rival Kevin Pietersen have been added to the commentary team. \n\nBrayshaw was nowhere to be mentioned anywhere in the announcement. \n\nIt is understood the former South Australian Sheffield Shield batsman chose not to be involved in the cricket coverage this summer and may return to the broadcast box in the future. \n\nBrayshaw’s decision to walk away comes after former Test players Brett Lee and Mike Hussey also parted ways with Channel 9. \n\nMark Nicholas will again be the centre piece of the Channel 9 commentary team with Mark Taylor, Shane Warne, Ian Chappell, Michael Slater, Ian Healy, Clarke and Pietersen to step up to the microphone. \n\nThe announcement also follows speculation Nine was considering adding a strong female voice to the team — as the broadcaster has done with Yvonne Sampson and Erin Molan in its rugby league coverage. \n\nAccording to reports Brayshaw has been in ongoing negotiations with Channel 9 over his football commitments with the network’s The Footy Show (AFL). \n\nThe negotiations have been described as “difficult” with some reports indicating the former North Melbourne chairman has even reached out to Channel 7 regarding a move to the rival broadcaster’s AFL commentary team. \n\nBrayshaw’s decision not to be involved with Nine this summer could spell the end of his hosting job on The Footy Show. \n\nThe AFL panel show has stumbled from one scandal to the next in recent years. \n\nBrayshaw has been credited by some for stabilising the show following the turbulent scandals involving Gary Lyon and Billy Brownless. \n\nFellow panel members Dave Hughes, Brownless and Shane Crawford are all in contract negotiations with Channel 9. Co-host Rebecca Maddern is in the first year of a three-year contract.\n\nNine will be screening the three Test series between Australia and South Africa, beginning Thursday, November 3, as well as the three-Test series against Pakistan, beginning December 15.\n\nNine also has the rights to Australia’s One Day International Series against New Zealand and the Twenty20 International series with Sri Lanka. \n\nBrayshaw’s decision was met with a mixed reaction from fans. \n\n","standFirst":"THE shake-up of the Channel 9 cricket commentary team continues with James Brayshaw no longer part of the broadcast unit.\n\n","kicker":"Out","byline":"Tyson Otto","commentsAllowed":false,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":false,"authorProfileIds":["5bbb92088447596039ef931c71a3ec84"],"bylineNames":["Tyson Otto"],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":[]},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":{"value":"41632b9b07872f5b00658d4ffcc2e5a6","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/content/v2/41632b9b07872f5b00658d4ffcc2e5a6"},"originId":"3572e8b2-94db-11e6-bdcd-5e2af82bec59","origin":"METHODE","channel":"NONE","title":"20 quirky stats from 2016 season","subtitle":"20 quirky stats from the 2016 AFL season","description":"DUSTIN Martin had the football world debating the merits of his best-on-ground performance against Essendon in Round 17.\n\n","link":"http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/41632b9b07872f5b00658d4ffcc2e5a6?domain=newscorpaustralia.com","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","originalSource":"Herald Sun","creditedSource":"Herald Sun","subscriptionSummary":"DUSTIN Martin scored three Brownlow Medal votes in Round 17 despite recording 18 ineffective kicks.

before you resign to a bland ghost, vampire or boy band member, here are a few ideas you should consider, especially if you want to be embarrassed or remanded on October 31.\n\nCARL WILLIAMS\n\nFor all those Underbelly fans, a red hoodie with jeans, ritzy sunnies and a stack of pineapples is all you need to look like the late pill kingpin Carl Williams.\n\nAnd for that real dealer look, chuck some vitamin tablets in a zip-lock bag. But don’t leave it on the front seat of the car when you’re going through a booze bus.\n\n.\n\nPARKING INSPECTOR\n\nNothing — nothing — is scarier than a costume like this, especially if you stand next to your friend’s car and look like you’re writing a ticket.\n\nA long-sleeved black shirt with high-vis, a radio and a notepad will make you the scariest person to stalk the darkened streets of inner Melbourne.\n\nDon’t forget it’s illegal to impersonate parking inspectors, kids, so don’t ever wear this.\n\nEVEN SPOOKIER: MEET GEOFFREY EDELSTEN’S NEW SQUEEZE\n\nZOMBIE CYCLIST\n\nSo many cyclists these days! And if you think they’re annoying already, imagine if they were trying to eat your brain.\n\nWhat a nightmare.\n\nA busted bike wheel with some fake blood, a ripped-up Lycra suit, helmet and a little makeup and bam. You’ll be staggering two abreast into hell.\n\nJULIAN ASSANGE\n\nEven if your internet isn’t working anymore, you can still have plenty of fun playing solitaire on your laptop while perusing thousands of classified documents while you wait for those pesky charges to expire.\n\nGet one of your friends to dress as a British police officer and you can play a fun spooky game of ‘don’t go outside or you’ll get extradited’.\n\nMAD CLOWN\n\nIt seems like just yesterday kids were all caught up in cargo pants and tipped hair.\n\nNow it’s all the rage to dress up as a clown and commit violent crime.\n\nAt least it makes the clown costume a hot item for this year’s Halloween — imagine how scary you’ll be if people genuinely think you might bash and rob them.\n\nIf you don’t have your own Victoria Police penalty notice for public nuisance, don’t worry.\n\nYou’ll likely get one within half an hour of tormenting strangers with this outfit.\n\nSKIPPING GIRL\n\nLight up the night and impress your Richmond friends by embodying the skipping vinegar neon sign.\n\nA skipping rope, red dress and patent leather shoes should do it. Stand on a chair or table for the full effect.\n\nThen wrap it all up with fairy lights and you’ll be as majestic as the Melbourne icon itself.\n\nJust try not to get too cosy with the electric cords.\n\nCHLOE\n\nThis is a really easy one if you’re stuck. Just put yourself in the frame and let nature do the rest.\n\nThen stand in the corner like Chloe at Young and Jackon’s and you’ll be the life of the party.\n\nEveryone reacts differently to public nudity, but police generally react by arresting you.\n\nSo leave before the police are called.\n\n","standFirst":"HALLOWEEN, once only celebrated by yanks and Europeans, is now pretty hot in

accused of keeping a ‘bully’","seoHeadline":"George Brandis under pressure to resign instead of Solicitor-General Justin Gleeson","userOriginUpdated":"raos","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"George-Brandis-under-pressure-to-go-instead-of-Justin-Gleeson","revision":20,"body":"Mr Shorten said Justin Gleeson’s resignation was “shameful, unprecedented, and ruthless”.\n\n“Malcolm Turnbull is so weak, devoid of strength that he has had to keep his bullying Attorney General,” Mr Shorten said.\n\n“Everyone knows this Attorney-General is an accident waiting to happen.”\n\nThe Opposition Leader also said Gleeson was pushed into resigning.\n\nThis comes as shadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus said the government “shot the messenger” over Gleeson’s resignation as pressure mounts for Brandis to go.\n\nMr Dreyfus said Australians can no longer trust Mr Brandis over the way he treated Mr Gleeson.\n\nHe also said the Coalition has set out to attack people appointed by Labor.\n\n“It has been regrettably the way in which this Government has operated, including the removal of secretaries of departments, the sacking of Paul Grimes, the attack on Gillian Triggs and now this Solicitor-General and there are other examples,” Mr Dreyfus said.\n\n“This Government cannot take criticism.\n\n“This government shoots the messenger every time.”\n\nPaul Grimes announced in 2015 that his role as head of the agriculture department was terminated citing differences in direction with Barnaby Joyce.\n\nEarlier Mr Dreyfus said he believed Senator Brandis should go.\n\n“The wrong person has gone,” he told ABC radio. \n\n“How many more disasters do Australians have to endure before Malcolm Turnbull sacks \n\nthis appalling attorney-general?\n\n“Everything he touches turns to ashes.” \n\nMr Dreyfus denied it was improper for him to call Mr Gleeson during the caretaker period before the recent election. \n\nHe questioned what the country has come to when a member of parliament can’t ask the solicitor-general, or any other senior public servant, a few questions. \n\nMalcolm Turnbull is standing by Brandis amid the pressure for him to resign.\n\nAustralia’s second law officer decided his relationship with Senator Brandis was irretrievably broken following changes to his role and he could no longer serve in the position. \n\nLabor says Brandis should be the one to go instead of Gleeson because he “misled” parliament.\n\nBut the Prime Minister today stood by the AG.\n\n“The solicitor-general has done the right thing ... and he’s resigned,” Mr Turnbull told ABC radio.\n\n“I thank Justin Gleeson for his service as Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General is doing a very good job as well.\n\n“It’s a pity the relationship broke down, but that does happen in other circumstances.” \n\nSenator Nick Xenophon also rejected calls for Brandis to be sacked.\n\n“Essentially he stuffed up,” Mr Xenophon said.\n\n“I don’t believe he misled the Senate. \n\n“I won’t be supporting a censure motion against the Attorney-General.” \n\nHowever, Mr Xenophon said there needs to be reform in how statutory officers are appointed. \n\nLabor MP Brendan O’Connor said Brandis was “a problem for the government”.\n\n“The person who told the truth got sacked and the person who told lies is still there and that’s a problem for the government,” he told Sky News this morning.\n\nProminent lawyer Julian Burnside QC has echoed the opposition’s claim. \n\n“The person who should have gone was Brandis, I mean Justin Gleeson is a very fine lawyer, Brandis isn’t,” he told ABC Radio. \n\nMr Burnside said he feared other lawyers of Mr Gleeson’s quality won’t want to replace him, if they are going to be overridden by Senator Brandis. \n\n“I suppose Justin Gleeson could have toughed it out,” he said.\n\n“I think he did the honourable thing which puts him in marked contrast with the way Brandis behaved.” \n\nSenator Brandis said Mr Gleeson’s resignation was the proper course of action. He will step down on November 7. \n\nThe top two government lawyers fronted a legal and constitutional affairs committee hearing in Canberra last week over allegations Senator Brandis failed to consult Mr Gleeson over a controversial new directive ruling that no-one in government, including the Prime Minister, could seek the Solicitor-General’s advice without first obtaining written permission.\n\nLabor claimed Senator Brandis had “misled” Parliament by saying Mr Gleeson was on-board with the changes.\n\n","standFirst":"BILL Shorten has lashed out at Malcolm Turnbull for keeping

Everitt, Dillon Viojo-Rainbow, Jason Tutt and Mark Whiley have all been told they won’t be offered contracts for next year.\n\nDELISTINGS AND RETIREMENTS: ALL YOUR CLUB’S LIST CHANGES\n\nRookies Andrew Galluci and Billy Gowers have also been cut, although the pair will continue to train with the Blues in the hope of being picked up again in this year’s rookie draft.\n\nEveritt has now been moved on from a third club after being traded from the Western Bulldogs to Sydney, and from the Swans to Carlton.\n\nHe has played 131 games in total and led the Blues’ goalkicking in 2015 with 31. He managed only 17 goals from 13 matches this year but that still placed him in the Blues’ top four behind Matthew Wright (22), Bryce Gibbs and Levi Casboult (both 18).\n\nWhile many players have responded to their off-season moves with messages of support and gratitude on social media, Everitt instead posted a so-bad-it’s-funny Photoshop image of himself.\n\nHe captioned the image: “Went with the subtle blue number to convince the jury I’m still one of the Blues”.\n\nFormer teammate Cameron Wood replied: “S--- news, elite pic.”\n\nTutt played 40 career games including 14 for Carlton after being traded from the Bulldogs.\n\nWhiley arrived at Carlton as part of a trade in 2014 with GWS that also netted Kristian Jaksch and pick 19 in the draft — used on Blaine Boekhorst — in return for pick 7. The Giants used the selection on Paul Ahern, traded last week to North Melbourne for pick 69 in this year’s draft.\n\nWhiley played nine games in two seasons at the Blues for a career total of 21.\n\nThe moves bring to 13 the number of list changes at Ikon Park — and an incredible 28 over the past two seasons — following the retirements of Andrew Walker and Michael Jamison and trading Zach Tuohy to Geelong.\n\nCarlton football manager Andrew McKay thanked the six delisted players for their service.\n\n“Since arriving at the club all six players have been professional in their approach to their careers and have shown dedication and commitment in developing their football,” McKay said. \n\n“We sincerely thank them for their contribution to Carlton and wish them all the best for the future.”\n\n","standFirst":"CARLTON has cut six players from its list and one has responded to the news with a so-bad-it’s-funny post on social media. \n\n","kicker":"Six axed","commentsAllowed":true,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":true,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":[],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":[]},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":{"value":"3a84729adfdbc6d13a7e867244f66c2d","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/content/v2/3a84729adfdbc6d13a7e867244f66c2d"},"originId":"1c518d8e-9a3f-11e6-8c86-36bc38a6a007","origin":"METHODE","channel":"NONE","title":"Eight Aussies step up for new NBA season","subtitle":"NBA: Dellavedova, Bogut, Exum, Baynes, Mills headline big Aussie contingent for new season","description":"BEN Simmons’ much-hyped NBA debut may have been torpedoed by a foot fracture, but with a record number of Australians in the NBA this season there’s plenty of other enticing storylines.\n\n","link":"http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/3a84729adfdbc6d13a7e867244f66c2d?domain=newscorpaustralia.com","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","originalSource":"AAP","creditedSource":"The Courier-Mail","originalAssetId":"1c518d8e-9a3f-11e6-8c86-36bc38a6a007","version":"PUBLISHED","dateUpdated":"2016-10-25T01:11:25.000Z","dateLive":"2016-10-25T01:11:00.000Z","customDate":"2016-10-25T01:11:00.000Z","dateCreated":"2016-10-24T23:10:53.000Z","status":"ACTIVE","thumbnailImage":{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":{"value":"c86b3cca56e317c3addf9e9c9796969d","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c86b3cca56e317c3addf9e9c9796969d"},"originId":"943f880e-9a4f-11e6-8c86-36bc38a6a007","origin":"METHODE","title":"Eight Aussies step up for new NBA season","subtitle":"943f880e-9a4f-11e6-8c86-36bc38a6a007","description":"Eight Aussies step up for new NBA season","link":"http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/thumbnail/c86b3cca56e317c3addf9e9c9796969d","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","originalSource":"AFP","version":"PUBLISHED","dateUpdated":"2016-10-25T01:08:46.000Z","dateLive":"2016-10-25T01:11:00.000Z","dateCreated":"2016-10-25T01:08:46.000Z","status":"ACTIVE","related":[],"domainLinks":[],"primaryCategory":{"value":"/author/newscorpaustralia.com/Kevin C.

Mills","userOriginUpdated":"gibbesm","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"NBA-Dellavedova-Bogut-Exum-Baynes-Mills-headline-big-Aussie-contingent-for-new-season","revision":1,"body":"\n\nDELLY A LEADER OF YOUNG BUCKS\n\nCan veteran big man Andrew Bogut stay healthy and make the Golden State Warriors regret shipping him off to the Dallas Mavericks to make space for superstar free agent Kevin Durant?\n\nIs Matthew Dellavedova worth the $50 million the Milwaukee Bucks tossed at him?\n\nWill Aron Baynes’ freshly broken nose and face mask, combined with his bushy ginger beard and samurai inspired, latte-making barista hipster dude man bun hairstyle give the Queenslander the title of fiercest-looking NBA enforcer (and maybe score him the role as the villain in the next 007 film)? \n\nThe 2016-17 NBA season begins on Wednesday (EDT) with Patty Mills’ San Antonio Spurs taking on the Golden State Warriors, the Joe Ingles-Dante Exum Utah Jazz playing the Portland Trail Blazers and the reigning champion Cleveland Cavaliers against the retooled New York Knicks.\n\nBookmakers predict the Warriors and the Cavaliers will, for the third straight year, meet in the NBA Championship, with the San Francisco Bay area squad with four All-Stars in their starting five — Durant, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson — victorious.\n\nHere’s how Australia’s record eight NBA players shape up.\n\nBEN SIMMONS (Philadelphia 76ers)\n\nPoor old Brett Brown, the former Australian Olympic coach who has suffered 199 losses and just 47 wins the past three seasons at the helm of the pitiful Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n2016/17 was supposed to be the turning point for the 76ers, with the wretched 2015/16 season (72 losses, 10 wins) putting them in pole position to score their saviour — Simmons — as the No. 1 pick in this year’s draft.\n\nTheir top pick in 2014, 213cm tall Joel Embiid, has never played a regular season game for the 76ers because of a fractured foot, but he is fit and was expected to join forces with 20-year-old Simmons.\n\nNope. Simmons fractured his foot last month and he might not play until January and the 76ers, who apparently like to walk under ladders and hang out with black cats, announced this week their string bean shot-blocker Nerlens Noel needs knee surgery.\n\nBookmaker prediction: 76ers will be the NBA’s third worst team. \n\nOdds to win NBA title: 500/1 (only Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns have longer odds) \n\nANDREW BOGUT (Dallas Mavericks) \n\nBogut, the 31-year-old, 11 NBA season veteran, has a lot at stake after the Warriors gave up on him and teammate Harrison Barnes to sign Durant. If Bogut and the Mavericks’ longtime star Dirk Nowitzki both stay healthy, they will likely make the playoffs and pose some problems for other Western Conference squads.\n\nBogut is at the end of his three-year, $47 million contract so if his creaky knees, ankles and back survive the season he will cash in with one last major deal.\n\nBookmakers: Expected to just miss playoffs.\n\nTitle odds: 100/1 \n\nMATTHEW DELLAVEDOVA & THON MAKER (Milwaukee Bucks) \n\nBuckle up because the Bucks are going to be fun to watch with Aussie duo Dellavedova and 19-year-old, 216cm Maker joining forces with the athletic 211cm Giannis “Greek Freak” Antetokounmpo.\n\nOpposing players might detest the scrappy Dellavedova, but he has never had an NBA coach (opposing coaches don’t count) who did not love him. With one of the highest great NBA point guards and current Bucks coach Jason Kidd pencilling Delly in to start at point guard (after expected starter Michael Carter-Williams was recently shipped off to the Chicago Bulls), Milwaukee looks like a great career move for the Victorian.\n\nMaker is a work in progress, but the Bucks love his enthusiasm, work ethic and unlimited potential.\n\nBookmakers: Will just miss playoffs \n\nTitle odds: 100/1 \n\nPATTY MILLS (San Antonio Spurs)\n\nIt’s a big year for Canberra point guard Mills Coming off an exemplary Olympic campaign, this will be Mills’ eighth NBA season and the perfect opportunity to show he can be more than a reserve and fill the ageing shoes of Spurs’ veteran starter Tony Parker.\n\nHe is also on the final year of his three-year $17 million contract and will be looking to cash in with a Delly-sized deal.\n\nAs always, the Spurs are expected to be in the top two in the Western Conference and strong title chances.\n\nFor the first time in 19 seasons the Spurs will be without great big man Tim Duncan, but his retirement has been soothed by the signing of proven winner forward/centre Paul Gasol.\n\nBookmakers: Second in Western Conference \n\nTitle odds: 8/1 \n\nJOE INGLES & DANTE EXUM (Utah Jazz)\n\nThe Utah Jazz could be the surprise team of the NBA.\n\nExum is back after sitting out last season with a torn ACL and the team added veterans Boris Diaw, George Hill and Joe Johnson.\n\nIngles might be a bit bleary-eyed from 3am nappy changing duties with the arrival of twins Jacob and Milla, but bookmakers and shrewd NBA analysts believe the Jazz will not only end their playoff drought but achieve a respectable playoff position in the stacked Western Conference.\n\nBookmakers: 5th to 8th playoff position.\n\nTitle odds: 50/1 \n\nARON BAYNES (Detroit Pistons) \n\nThe burly Queenslander Baynes arrived in Detroit last season on an eyebrow-raising three-year $25.5 million deal, but he proved his worth as a key backup to starting centre Andre Drummond.\n\nIt helps Baynes can shoot free throws, with Drummond (shooting an historically bad 35.5 per cent last season) targeted with hack-a-Drummond in the final minutes of games.\n\nPistons coach Stan Van Gundy has enough confidence to toss Baynes, who also had a great Rio Olympics, in when the game is on the line.\n\nBaynes did break his nose in a pre-season game last week, but after surgery he is expected to play in the Pistons’ opener.\n\nBookmakers: Just miss playoffs \n\nTitle odds: 100/1\n\n","standFirst":"CAN Andrew Bogut stay healthy? Is Matthew Dellavedova worth $50m? Will Patty Mills step up?

the Coalition moves to end so-called “double dipping” — where new mums receive taxpayer-funded parental leave at the same time to employer-provided payments — Mr Hockey has run up a $2500 bill for child minding in just his first few months as US ambassador.\n\nThe babysitting bill is revealed in Government documents released under Freedom of Information which detail the annual expenditure for the head of Mission in Washington D.C. in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 financial years.\n\nThe Former treasurer who delivered the infamous 2014 slash-and-burn budget moved to Washington in January with his wife and three children for his new role.\n\nIn the 2015-16 financial year, Mr Hockey and former US ambassador Kim Beazley charged taxpayers more than $120,000 to wine and dine guests.\n\nMr Hockey, who earns more than $360,000 a year as ambassador and has access to an annual pension worth almost $100,000 also billed taxpayers thousands of dollars to restock the cellar and for decorative flowers.\n\nThe latest figures come just months after the Herald Sun revealed Mr Hockey had charged taxpayers $8500 to spruce up his palatial Washington home after staff reported there was “no space available” for him to host visitors.\n\nEarlier this year the Hockeys’ also advertised for a new ­housekeeper in Washington to “prepare and serve meals for members of the family and their guests”.\n\nThe position cames with a taxpayer-funded salary of $45,750.\n\nIt is believed Mr Hockey is renting out his multimillion-dollar, six-bedroom family home in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill.\n\nMore to come\n\n","standFirst":"JOE Hockey, who once declared that the “age of entitlement” was over, has billed taxpayers thousands of dollars for babysitters to mind his three children,

Biel complained he’d watched a bloke severely bashed while awaiting sentence in Port Phillip prison over a series of terrifying armed robberies.\n\nBut the cowardly 18-year old may yet get his wish, with County Court Judge Felicity Hampel considering his plea.\n\nBiel faces up to 25-years behind bars after pleading guilty to a series of armed robberies against unsuspecting citizens.\n\nThe court heard Biel and two others who were dealt with in the Children’s Court embarked on a crime rampage across Melbourne on April 10 last year.\n\nDriving about in a stolen ex-taxi, Biel and his mates attacked random strangers, bashing them with an extendible baton and stealing their phones and cash.\n\nOne man was robbed in Southbank and another two in Richmond.\n\nIn each of the attacks, the goons approached passers-by and asked for their phones before robbing them.\n\nOne man was struck in the head before being kicked while another was ruthlessly beaten in his own car.\n\nThe thugs told the man they would track him down and kill him if he went to police and later used his bank cards to withdraw cash.\n\nThe brazen bandits were captured on CCTV using the cards at Chadstone, but the unrepentant Biel denied he was involved.\n\nHe eventually ratted on his mates to police while attempting to minimise his involvement in the crimes.\n\nIn Biel’s defence, barrister Caitlin Blakeney said her young client found he preferred to go out socialising than doing schoolwork.\n\nShe said Biel migrated to Australia from Sudan and picked up an ice habit in 2014.\n\nHis habit turned into an addiction, which she claimed was aided by good-willed drug fiends, who freely handed-over drugs to Biel.\n\nMs Blakeney told the court her client had a borderline mental impairment and was struggling to cope in an adult jail.\n\nBiel has been locked-up since committing the offences.\n\nShe said Biel had been bullied in jail and witnessed an inmate cop a severe beating.\n\nCrown prosecutors did not object to Biel being assessed for juvenile detention.\n\nHe will be sentenced on November 22.\n\nwayne.flower@news.com.au \n\n","standFirst":"A LYING thug has complained he doesn’t like it in an adult

Daniel Andrews announced the crackdown on the “wretched” miniature motorbikes this morning and will introduce laws to Parliament today to help police take them off the road.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Doug Fryer said the dangerous vehicles were not allowed on public roads and that police were sick of youths harassing people while riding them.\n\nIt comes after Carrum mum Andrea Lehane was hit and killed by a teenager riding a monkey bike in a shopping centre last year.\n\n“The Lehane family today still grieve the loss of somebody so close to them, the tragic death ... all of us I think were touched by, at the hands of one of these miniature motorcycles,” Mr Andrews said.\n\nUnder the new laws, monkey bike riders who are caught on the roads by police will be taken to court, charged with a new specific offence that carries a fine of up to $3109.\n\nThe bike can also be impounded and crushed.\n\n“These are exactly the laws that Victoria Police have asked for when it comes to dealing with the menace of monkey bikes on our roadways,” Mr Andrews said.\n\nMr Fryer said the changes would help police keep the streets safe.\n\n“Kids might think it’s good fun, we know that this causes serious injury and it can cause death and we’ve seen that,” he said.\n\n“Our streets are not for monkey bikes ... They’re dangerous little motorised vehicles that can cause death.”\n\nPolice received about 6000 calls about people riding monkey bikes last year.\n\ntom.minear@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"MONKEY

Yarra railway station Melbourne Metro ultimatum made by Turnbull Government","userOriginUpdated":"huntej","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"HeraldSun","urlTitle":"Turnbull-Government-makes-600m-South-Yarra-railway-station-ultimatum","revision":2,"body":"The Turnbull Government is threatening to pay the money that is owed to Victoria only if South Yarra railway station is included.\n\nThe $10.9 billion Melbourne Metro does not currently include plans for a stop at South Yarra, despite proposed new rail lines passing within 80 metres of the station.\n\nThe State Government says it would cost too much.\n\nThis morning Public Transport Minister Jacinta Allan said the South Yarra extension did not stack up financially and would only provide a minimal return on investment.\n\nShe said the potential federal offer was simply about saving Liberal MP Kelly O’Dwyer in the seat of Higgins, and accused the Turnbull Government of playing politics with money that was owed to Victoria.\n\nVictoria is in a standoff with Canberra over a bonus owed the state under the federal Asset Recycling Initiative for the Port of Melbourne sale.\n\nThe Andrews Government argues that under the original terms of the federal scheme, Victoria should receive $1.45 billion — 15 per cent of the $9.7 billion the state will get from selling the port.\n\nThe Commonwealth has agreed in principle to give Victoria $877 million.\n\nBut it is now debating whether to offer the rest only if a new South Yarra station is linked to the Metro project.\n\nThe push to tie the $600 million to South Yarra is being led by Assistant Treasurer Kelly O’Dwyer, whose seat of Higgins takes in the station and who has been a vocal critic of its omission. \n\nSenior federal Victorian Liberals are understood to have told Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull it would be unacceptable for the state to get only $877 million, and that the matter needs to be resolved as quickly as possible. \n\nVictoria has rejected attempts by Canberra to dictate what the cash is spent on.\n\nTreasurer Tim Pallas said in June that any money from the Asset Recycling Initiative would go towards removing more level crossings. \n\nThe standoff comes as the Andrews Government argues Victoria is only getting 9c in every infrastructure dollar Canberra currently spends.\n\nA senior federal Victorian Liberal called the construction of Melbourne Metro is “a once in a generation project”.\n\n The source said the project passes within 80 metres of South Yarra station, and “if South Yarra station isn’t connected to the Melbourne Metro, the millions of commuters who use the Frankston, Cranbourne, Pakenham and Sandringham lines will be worse off.”\n\nChapel Street Precinct Association president John Lotton said an estimated 30,000 people passed through the station every day, despite the State Government’s estimate of closer to 24,000. “South Yarra station (is) the second busiest train station in Victoria, after Flinders Street station, in the mornings,” he said.\n\n“We need the Metro Rail to link to the second busiest station, and it doesn’t make sense that Metro Rail will come within 100m of the station.\n\n“We have Kelly O’Dwyer offering federal government funds, but we have a State Government refusing to say whether they are going to stump up the cash.\n\n“The core issue is about the substantial increase of the population in the area. It’s a considerable issue for a government which continues to grant permits for high-rises in the area, increasing the local population, but refuses to include South Yarra in upgrade plans,” Mr Lotton said.\n\n“Commuters are sick of seeing several trains, chocker block, in the morning, having to bypass South Yarra without stopping, because they’re too full for people to get on.”\n\njames.campbell@news.com.au\n\nMELBOURNE METRO CREATIVE CONSULTANTS TO CASH IN ON PROJECT’S ‘LOOK AND FEEL’\n\nPRIME MINISTER WITHHOLDS $1.4 BILLION ASSET RECYCLING CASH \n\n","standFirst":"THE

bottles of champagne and sparkling","userOriginUpdated":"rossk","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"HeraldSun","urlTitle":"Bubbly-guide-11-bottles-of-sparking-and-champagne-for-any-occassion","revision":6,"body":"The weather is turning for the better and so is our desire for the fun things in life — and when it comes to a little something to kickstart a great event, nothing beats the pop of a cork and the froth and bubble of a great little sparkler.\n\nFrom now until the New Year, we drink way more fizz than the rest of the calendar as the great annual celebrations dominate our diaries. \n\nThe rise and rise of Australian sparklings as Tasmania gains increasing kudos as an elite source is a heartening domestic trend. \n\nOther cooler-climate areas also can’t be denied — think the Yarra Valley in Victoria and the Adelaide Hills. \n\nLarger wine companies have excellent programs for sparklings, arguably one of the most complex of all wines to create with intricate blending processes and many years of bottle maturation required to attain the best expressions.\n\nAnd then there are the French. Australia is the seventh largest champagne market in the world, growing threefold since 2009. We obviously love the sense of luxury that the Champagne region brings to a bottle of celebratory wine. \n\nThe best thing about a great bottle of fizz is that it can be enjoyed in so many ways.\n\nIt’s a party-starter, a romance, a special occasion highlight, and also a fabulous dining companion across just about any food style you can imagine. \n\nHere’s a selection across many price points for you to get the season off to a cracking start.\n\nYellowglen Yellow Brut Cuvee\n\n$13\n\nRegion: Various\n\nValue: Good\n\nBest with: Sunny daytime party\n\n***1/2 \n\nChampagne fanciers might turn up their noses, but this little crowd pleaser does a mighty fine job at its price. It’s crisp and clean with lemon sherbet senses, the bubbles are fine, and even a little maturation adds light pith in its mouthfeel. Super easy to splash around, it’s smartly balanced between sweeter flavours and refreshing acidity. You can also find it in a gold bottle these days. \n\nYarra Burn Vintage 2013\n\n$25\n\nRegion: Yarra Valley\n\nValue: Attractive\n\nBest with: Stronger cheeses\n\n**** \n\nOne of the key producers under the excellent Accolade Wines bubbles program directed by master sparkler Ed Carr, this single region, single vintage expression reflects the fuller flavoured YB house style. This certainly shows in the turn of power and depth in the palate here, the fruit spectrum varying from citrus, pear and apple with a creamy mouthfeel and after two years maturation in the bottle a nice little yeast bun complexity. \n\nYarrabank Crème de Cuvee NV\n\n$30\n\nRegion: Yarra Valley\n\nValue: Sweet\n\nBest with: Strawberry tartlets \n\n****1/2\n\nThe colour immediately sets the mood — the producers call it “strawberry blonde” yet there’s a surprise here, it’s delicately sweeter in style with the palate suggesting fruit ripeness rather than honey while retaining its acidity and freshness. The balancing act is not surprising given it’s a collaboration between Yering Station and French Champagne house Devaux. Think of it more for desserts. \n\nBay of Fires Pinot Noir Chardonnay Brut\n\n$35\n\nRegion: Tasmania\n\nValue: Cool\n\nBest with: Sashimi\n\n****1/2\n\nAnother from the Accolade program and also benefiting from being sourced across several of the exciting regions of Tasmania. There’s no shirking here — this is a fully expressive style, cast in a mid-rich spectrum, showing a light note of honey drizzled over apple in the initial aromatic and flavour senses. Move on through and with four years maturation in the bottle on the yeast lees, a technique that defines all the best fizzes, you see more complexity, woody herbs and florals and a lovely lemon sherbet finish. \n\nColdstream Hills 2013 Pinot Noir Chardonnay\n\n$35\n\nRegion: Yarra Valley\n\nValue: Dependable\n\nBest with: Cocktail party\n\n****1/2\n\nA consistently excellent Yarra based sparkling, this vintage finds its place in the fresher, more aperitif spectrum to begin, before all the complexities of better sparkling techniques mesh together so you come across yeast, polish, zest and pith from various citrus, superfine bubbles and mouth-watering yet harmonious acidity — all sorts of goodness and joy and with enough layering to be a solid dining companion too.\n\nArras Brut Elite Cuvee No. 901\n\n$50\n\nRegion: Tasmania\n\nValue: Top class\n\nBest with: Your best friend\n\n*****\n\nThe House of Arras leads the way in Australian sparkling wines, this core of the range up to super-elite vintage styles equal to anything the best of France can make. The “901” cuvee number indicates a dominant 2009 vintage component and thus five years bottle ferment and maturation time to encourage engaging yeasty complexity with amazing freshness. Subtle, salivating with crunchy apple and pear flavours. Very smart. \n\nBromley by Wolf Blass pinot noir Chardonnay NV\n\n$30 \n\nRegion: Adelaide Hills\n\nValue: Stylish\n\nBest with: Browned butter scallops\n\n**** \n\nYou might think this is mostly about the packaging — the label a bright bird and butterfly artwork by popular painter David Bromley — but the wine itself is beyond all that, fresh and zesty with lemon peel and juice, perhaps a slice of grapefruit too to enhance its mouth-watering appeal. Then look again and three years bottle maturation also has added depth in a lemon butter and bun character. Yum.\n\nChandon Altius Vintage 2012 \n\n$59\n\nRegion: Yarra Valley\n\nValue: Cellar special\n\nBest with: Finest seafoods\n\n****1/2\n\nThe Chandon house has plenty of sparkling options and this is a cellar door style only, so if you’re in the Yarra region, drop in and get one. Specifically noting cooler terroir Upper Yarra fruit, you’ll see it in a delightful chardonnay/ pinot noir duet that begins with a distinctive mature, yeasty note — a plus in sparkling appreciation — then excellent palate precision: pithy, lemons, crisp apples, with a fine mousse and bubbles. Excellent. \n\nJacquart Brut Mosaic NV\n\n$70\n\nRegion: Champagne, France\n\nValue: Terrific\n\nBest with: Morning tea\n\n**** \n\nThis Champagne house drives its cuvee with a serious component of chardonnay, so its delicacy is a feature as well as its fresher fruit notes that tend more towards the pear spectrum of flavours with some orange florals as well. It’s juicy and refreshing with easy going popular styling, yet also will please aficionados with five years on lees resulting in some baked yeast and honey bun complexity too. \n\nMumm Cordon Rouge NV\n\n$70\n\nRegion: Champagne, France\n\nValue: Discounted well\n\nBest with: A happy crowd\n\n**** \n\nThis regular Mumm is one of the best introductions to the world of Champagne as it’s such an smoothly crafted expression of the style, the depth of its 45 per cent pinot noir balanced supremely with a more subtle 30 per cent chardonnay, opening with wafts of cut orange and mandarin peel, those fragrant citrus notes continuing and lifted with fine bubbles. Pleasing, easy going, and often heavily discounted.\n\nBollinger Special Cuvee NV\n\n$80\n\nRegion: Champagne, France\n\nValue: Why not\n\nBest with: Party crowd\n\n****1/2\n\nThe name of course conjures plenty of fun-filled moments as well as James Bond imagery, and the wine itself is a classic expression of the three Champagne varieties with 85 per cent grand and premier cru components. It’s fresh and floral to start with a subtle polish in the background. A core of sweet fruit like compote apples drives the flavour notes before a long dry finish with lemon gelati impressions. \n\nPol Roger Pure NV\n\n$125\n\nRegion: Champagne France\n\nValue: Rare\n\nBest with: Oysters, natural\n\n****1/2\n\nThis palate teasing style is definitely not for every taste — very much an aperitif with what’s known as “zero dosage” of liqueuring in its final stages of production so the wine’s acidity has been left to do the talking. The result: green apple crunch and bite, super fresh palate edge, with a pithy and minerally finish. There’s not too much of it around but worth looking out for if that’s your thing. \n\n@TonyLoveTaste\n\n","standFirst":"WHETHER you have $13 to spend or want to splash out up to $125, these top

her sensational Cox Plate victory at the weekend, Waller confirmed Winx will go for a spell immediately and would not run in the Group 1 $2 million Emirates Stakes (2000m) at Flemington on November 5 in order to be set for a Sydney autumn campaign.\n\n“(Asking her to run) it’s like asking Usain Bolt to run, I wouldn’t say a marathon, but the 1500m,” he told reporters at Flemington.\n\n“It calls on different resources from a horse, they’re under pressure at different stages, their bodies are set up differently.\n\n“We might have missed the boat with Winx (to race both). You could have probably done it last year, but she was only a shadow of what she’s at now.”\n\nBolt is the talk of the town in Melbourne after it was confirmed the nine-time Olympic gold medallist will be trackside at Flemington during the Melbourne Cup Carnival and will be a guest of Crown Melbourne, appearing in their marquee on Oaks Day, November 3.\n\n“It will be my first time to attend this type of event. I hear it is the place to be in Melbourne in November and people like to dress up,” Bolt said last week.\n\nWinx extended her winning streak to 13 when she won the Cox Plate by a staggering eight lengths — the biggest margin ever in the race — and lifted her prizemoney to $9.34 million to be third on the all-time list of leading prizemoney earners.\n\nWinx’s next main target is likely to be the $4 million Queen Elizabeth Stakes (2000m) at Royal Randwick during The Championships but she is expected to return to racing in February.\n\n","standFirst":"CHRIS Waller has provided further

Luca, 22, was on remand for a string of offending including beating a woman with a pole when he enthusiastically took part in the 15-hour Ravenhall rampage.\n\nHe was later sentenced to 42 months’ imprisonment, and ordered to serve at least two years of that term, for that offending.\n\nToday, in a sign that the rioters wouldn’t be dealt with lightly, County Court chief judge Peter Kidd sentenced Luca to another two years and five months.\n\nThe Chief Judge ordered that 21 months of Luca’s latest sentence be added to a term he is already serving.\n\nA new 18-month non-parole period, that starts today, means for all his offending Luca must spend a total of three years behind bars.\n\n“The courts cannot permit the law of the jungle to take hold in prisons,” Chief Judge Kidd told him.\n\n“The riot had a major impact on the staff at the MRC (Metropolitan Remand Centre),” he said\n\n“It has affected the way they now interact with the prisoners on a day-to-day basis.”\n\nUp to 300 people were involved in the wild prison brawl, the largest in Victorian history, but just 102 have been charged.\n\nLuca was the first to plead guilty to his involvement in the violent protest that erupted over a looming smoking ban in Victorian correctional facilities.\n\nHundreds of prisoners came close to breaking free from Melbourne’s Metropolitan Remand Centre as fearful prison staff fled for their safety.\n\nPrisoners stormed the centre’s gatehouse and control centre, crashed through fences with vehicles, lit fires and attacked guards.\n\nThey also ransacked the prison’s canteen and used allen keys to free prisoners from their cells.\n\nIn a letter to a friend in the wake of the riot Luca bragged that “the whole joint is smashed to bits. We got the allen keys from maintenance and got all the people out from the slot.”\n\nLuca pleaded guilty to a single count of riot.\n\nJudge Kidd said his youth was a significant mitigating factor because of his potential for rehabilitation.\n\nshannon.deery@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"THE first prisoner to be sentenced over the violent prison riots that left a $12 million clean-up bill will

Dellavedova Milwaukee Bucks NBA debut: Delly on Bucks, Boomers, Cavs, life and love, Cleveland","userOriginUpdated":"randallm","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Matthew-Dellavedova-opens-up-on-the-Bucks-Boomers-Cavs-life-and-love-ahead-of-his-Milwaukee-debut","revision":6,"body":"The Australian Boomer confirmed he will be in the Bucks’ starting line-up when the Charlotte Hornets visit the Bradley Center on Thursday.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Bogut, Delly make NBA debuts with new clubs\n\nDellavedova joined a talent-laden Milwaukee roster on a massive four year, $US38 million deal in the off-season, after winning the title with Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nAnd his new club has given him a huge vote of confidence after it traded his main rival for the starting spot, Michael Carter-Williams to the Chicago Bulls.\n\nMORE: Matthew Dellavedova’s tennis playing cousin is named Matthew Dellavedova\n\nWhile the Bucks have a young, multi-talented star in Giannis Antetokounmpo leading the way and third-year big man Jabari Parker, he’s joined a side that is still finding its way in the NBA, having missed the playoffs last season.\n\n“We’ve only had six preseason games, so it’s still pretty early on, but Giannis obviously is an amazing talent and he really has no limit on how good he can be,” Dellavedova said.\n\n“I’m here to fit in with him and just try to help him become as good as he can be.”\n\nAnd he says it is his job to help his teammates improve, with the goal of make it back to the postseason — even without injured marksman Khris Middleton.\n\n“The feeling is we have to get back into the playoffs and then go from there,” Dellavedova said.\n\n“You have to take it step by step, but the first thing is getting back in the playoffs and then I think we reset our goals and talk about what we want to do next after that.\n\nMORE: Delly on Pat Beverley toughness questions\n\n“It’s something we’ve talked about in training camp and it’s great to have big goals, but you need to know how you’re going to get there.”\n\nDellavedova’s first task in a deer emblem will be to curtail Hornets’ jet Kemba Walker.\n\nAnd he says he knows he will need the help of his teammates to keep the high-scoring guard in check.\n\nMORE: Title win still sinking in: Delly\n\n“He’s pretty tough to cover, he’s very quick and crafty with the ball and a good shooter as well,” he said.\n\n“We’re going to be a defensive team and that’s where our strength is and our athleticism and getting out and running.\n\n“So every night we have to do it on the defensive end and that’s where it begins with us.”\n\nDellavedova says he has warmed to Bucks NBA journeyman Steve Novak, who attended local Marquette University.\n\nMORE: Why we’re looking forward to the NBA season\n\n“He’s the local guy here ... so he’s been showing me around Milwaukee,” Dellavedova said.\n\n“He knows (Boomer’s teammate and Utah Jazz forward) Joey Ingles and Joey said he was a good bloke, which was true, so it’s good.”\n\nHe says coming back from 3-1 down to win the NBA title against Golden State last season after losing to the Warriors in 2015 was one of his greatest career highlights.\n\n“It’s a marathon of a season and to come up short the year before after being so close was really disappointing and then just to get back there again and have the chance to compete for the title and get it done was pretty awesome,” he said.\n\nWhile his focus is on the Bucks, Dellavedova says the Boomers’ bronze medal game capitulation against Spain at the Olympics still stings — and that means Tokyo 2020 is always in the back of his mind.\n\n“It’s still a tough one to digest how it all ended, but that was as fun a group as I’ve been a part of,” he said.\n\n“Just how close everybody was, all that mattered was the team, which is how it is in Australian sport.\n\n“Everybody is fully committed to the Boomers program and wants to do something special for Australia, but, unfortunately, we couldn’t finish off the job in Rio and it's a disappointing one that’s going to sting for a long time.\n\n“But that’s what happens in sport sometimes and hopefully we can regroup and go better in 2020.”\n\nHe desperately wants the NBL to succeed and says his Aussie NBA brethren follow the competition from afar.\n\n“I think all of us over here follow the NBL and want it to do really well and it looks like it’s definitely heading in the right direction,” he said.\n\nHe’s torn between his home state club, Melbourne United, and the reincarnated Brisbane Bullets, when it comes to support.\n\n“I definitely want United to do well, obviously, being a Victorian, but my best mate (Mitch Young) plays with Brisbane, so I’ve been following them pretty closely this year as well,” he said.\n\nThe pair spent three years at the Australian Institute of Sport and then four years at US college St Mary’s as roommates.\n\nHe still heads back to St Mary’s every off season.\n\n“I follow them and still talk to the coaches and always drop in before and after the season to catch up with everybody,” he said.\n\nDellavedova says while he’s not a big-spender, the big money deal has allowed him to buy his first house, which gives him a base, “rather than living out of a suitcase”.\n\nIt’s been the year of dreams for Delly.\n\nHe has an NBA title, a big money deal, a starting role — and a new fiancee.\n\nHe popped the question to his college sweetheart Anna Schroeder in the off season.\n\n“(It’s) definitely exciting times,” he said.\n\n“I had a bit of a plan and it worked out pretty well, and it was something you would never forget for sure.”\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on his plan, he just laughed.\n\n“I’ll probably keep that one a secret, but it was very romantic,” he said.\n\nLet’s hope the romantic from Maryborough’s dream run can continue this NBA season.\n\nThe NBA season tips off on Wednesday with a triple header featuring the new-look New York Knicks up against James and the Cavs, the Utah Jazz taking on the Portland Trailblazers and the post-Tim Duncan era San Antonio Spurs visiting the Golden State Warriors’ super team in Oakland.\n\nDelly’s Bucks take on the Hornets on Thursday from 11am, while Aussie centre Andrew Bogut’s debut with the Dallas Mavericks (against Indiana) is an hour earlier at 10am.\n\n*All times AEDT\n\n","standFirst":"MATTHEW Dellavedova says he’s gone from being “a younger guy on an

the hidden gems of Victoria’s diverse west.\n\nharrow.org.au\n\nIs Harrow the oldest inland settlement in Victoria? The locals — and there are 100 of them — reckon it is. \n\nOne thing’s for sure: this quaint spot in the Wimmera, overlooking the Glenelg River Valley, \n\nis on a new list of the “most irresistible, historic and postcard-worthy small towns in Australia’’. \n\nLook around and you can see why. \n\nHarrow’s hotel and general store laid their foundations in the 1840s and are still in use today. The town — straddling sheep and crop country — also fields a footy team, hosts a billycart championship and stages monthly “Harrow By Night” light and sound shows from September to March. \n\nThe Grampians. parkweb.vic.gov.au\n\nRock climbing is a big drawcard in the Gariwerd-Grampians National Park, but not everything \n\nhere comes with an altitude. \n\nFor a less strenuous experience, seek out the indigenous rock art sites that abound in the park’s rocky uplands. These “shelters” are where Aboriginal people camped and painted images of their life and law on sandstone walls, and Ngamadjidj, a secluded waterhole on the Grampians’ western edge, are unusual for being made with white clay. \n\nAll the sites — not far from Halls Gap — are easily accessible and protected. \n\nWyperfeld National Park, near Patchewollock.\n\nparkweb.vic.gov.au\n\n“Snow Drift” perfectly describes one of Victoria’s little-known natural marvels — a complex of towering, blindingly-white sand dunes in the Wyperfeld National Park, near Patchewollock, \n\n450km northwest of Melbourne. \n\nSmack-bang in the middle of an archetypal dusty, red Mallee landscape, the naturally-occurring dunes are accessible by car. Sand surfing — flying down the face of the dunes on boogie boards or even Esky lids — is the No. 1 attraction. \n\nThe dunes were formed between 15,000 and 40,000 years ago, after the shallow sea that covered much of northwest Victoria receded. \n\nThe area has unpowered camp sites, toilets and picnic tables.\n\n107 Brown St, Hamilton. hamiltongallery.org\n\nEvery regional Victorian gallery has a special focus. At Hamilton Art Gallery, decorative art is the drawcard, thanks to Herbert and May Shaw who bequeathed the museum their rare 800-piece collection of 18th and 19th-century European silver, glass and porcelain. \n\nAsia has been also been a gallery priority, especially Chinese ceramics, and this summer Chinese-Australian artist Ah Xian enjoys an exhibition (from November 5). \n\n19 Sackville St, Port Fairy. wishartgallery.com.au\n\nFor some divine inspiration, pull into Glenthompson on your way through the Western District and inspect the murals inside the town’s Anglican Church. Artist Gareth Colliton decorated its walls three years ago, depicting some of the townsfolk in Biblical scenes. \n\nTravel south to Port Fairy and you will find Colliton — and his brothers Rhys, Bruach and Alasdair — at Wishart Gallery, Cafe and Bar. Housed in a recently refurbished heritage building, Wishart is home to art, antiques, food and a big outdoor beer garden. \n\n98 Parker St, Dunkeld. royalmail.com.au\n\nChefs at the Royal Mail Hotel in Dunkeld are always in the thick of it, returning with armfuls of fruit, vegetables and herbs. But their 1.2ha organic kitchen garden — Australia’s biggest — is open to house guests as well. Gardener Michelle Shanahan leads weekday tours. Over spring and summer, Grampians visitors can enrol in Royal Mail’s Sunday kitchen garden workshops. It’s part of a premium package ($795 per couple), which includes a gardener’s afternoon tea, dinner, overnight accommodation, breakfast and take home plantings. \n\n271 Pierrepoint Rd, Tarrington. pierrepointwines.com.au\n\nOut in the Henty region, near Hamilton, the volcanic soil is good for planting pinot and chardonnay but tasting the fruits of Western District winemaking can be tricky when many cellar doors are by appointment only. That makes Pierrepoint Wines a special find. Lodged in the hills around Tarrington, west of Dunkeld, this vineyard is “open most days’’ from 11am to 6pm and you’re bound to meet owners Andrew or Jennifer Lacey. Between yarns, taste their award-winning wines, hear some live music and — if you’re overnighting — bunk down in one of the bed and breakfast rooms. \n\n21 Thistle Place, Port Fairy. www.timeandtidehightea.com.au\n\nWaves are always crashing and the pot is always full \n\nat Time and Tide Gallery Cafe. This coastal eatery, overlooking the Southern Ocean near Port Fairy, serves afternoon tea on Saturdays and Sundays ($59). And owners Stephen and Philippa Hocking present their finger sandwiches, savoury pastries and petite treats with old-world charm.\n\nCape Bridgewater. sealsbyseatours.com.au\n\nEver wanted to go snorkelling with seals? \n\nYou can do it off Cape Bridgewater on Victoria’s southwest coast. Seals by Sea Tours, in Portland, have long hosted Zodiac cruises out to Seal Point, home to 1200 Australian and New Zealand fur seals. But a new attraction allows visitors to jump into a dive cage moored off Bridgewater and caper with the creatures for about 90 minutes (adults $60, children $30). \n\n97 Martin St, corner Sterling St, Dunkeld. dunkeldoldbakery.com.au\n\nWaking up to the aromas of just-baked bread ... that romantic notion is closer than you think if you stay at Dunkeld Old Bakery. The Scotch oven in this building has been in service since 1887 and under owners Iwona and Harry Wakeling, it is still turning out sourdough loaves, gourmet pies and country cakes. Two rooms \n\nin the “Baker’s House” are so close to the bakery cafe, you’re sure to be first in line for Harry’s morning bake. \n\n2810 Hamilton Hwy, Darlington. elephantbridgehotel.com.au\n\nOld hands reckon it got its name from a circus that once crisscrossed the Western District. New owners of the Elephant Bridge Hotel cannot swear to that. But in reopening this classic bluestone pub on the Hamilton Highway at Darlington, they are putting an end to a period when circuses — and tourists — passed it by. “We’re offering boutique accommodation very soon,’’ says proprietor Karin Blomquist. Meanwhile, call into the hotel (c. 1842) for all-day cafe grazing, a “hunter gatherer’’ menu in the dining room, and local wines in the bar. \n\nA history of Melbourne\n\n","standFirst":"VICTORIA’S west has everything from a stunning coastline to incredible inland sand dunes.

Herald Sun has obtained the letter written by former secretary of the Agriculture Department, Paul Grimes, who was sacked after firing off the furious missive to his boss back in 2015.\n\nThe letter was released after a lengthy legal fight between the Herald Sun and the Agriculture Department, which last week abandoned efforts in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to block its release.\n\nDr Grimes tells Mr Joyce he “no longer has confidence in my capacity to resolve matters relating to integrity with you.’’\n\nHe writes that he has come to the realisation following the events “before and following the alterations to Hansard that were made in October 2014.’’\n\nHis comments relate to Mr Joyce’s staff getting the official Parliamentary record, Hansard, changed in a way that disguised an incorrect answer Mr Joyce had given to Parliament that inflated the number of households receiving drought assistance.\n\nSo incensed was Dr Grimes that departmental staff were embroiled in the scandal dubbed “Hansardgate’’ that Dr Grimes concluded that his and Mr Joyce’s relationship was “irretrievably’’ broken.\n\nDr Grimes goes on to say: “As I have conducted myself appropriately at all times, I have no intention of resigning or stepping aside.’’\n\nHe then sought to withdraw the letter, and was sacked days later.\n\nLabor’s agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon, who uncovered the doctoring of Hansard, said the Government had wasted two years and up to $1 million in taxpayer funds trying to cover up the scandal.\n\n“No wonder Barnaby Joyce has fought tooth and nail to keep this letter secret — it’s dynamite,’’ Mr Fitzgibbon said.\n\n“A highly respected public servant was sacked because he challenged Barnaby Joyce and the dodgy things he was doing.\n\n“It is clear from his letter that Dr Grimes was first bullied and then sacked for trying to protect the reputation of his Department and those who serve it.”\n\nMr Joyce’s office said the letter described “sentiments’’ written when the relationship between a secretary and minister had broken down irretrievably.\n\n“This letter is not a direct insight into the working relationships of the Department and the Deputy Prime Minister, and has not been for more than 17 months,’’ Mr Joyce’s spokeswoman said.\n\nShe said Mr Joyce was pleased to have a “good working relationship’’ with current Agriculture secretary Daryl Quinlivan, and he wished Dr Grimes well in the future.\n\nA departmental lawyer advised that the appeal had been abandoned because: “While the Secretary remains of the view that the document in question is properly characterised as deliberative, it is recognised that the public interest test is multifaceted and that the passage of time can impact on how various considerations are to be weighed in the balance.’’\n\nellen.whinnett@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"DEPUTY Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce’s integrity has been questioned in a blistering letter from his chief bureaucrat, which

Justin Gleeson resigns after row with George Brandis","userOriginUpdated":"dmills","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"SolicitorGeneral-Justin-Gleeson-resigns-after-row-with-AttorneyGeneral-George-Brandis","revision":14,"body":"The top two government lawyers fronted a legal and constitutional affairs committee hearing in Canberra last week over allegations Senator Brandis failed to consult Mr Gleeson over a controversial new directive ruling that no-one in government, including the Prime Minister, could seek the Solicitor-General’s advice without first obtaining written permission.\n\nLabor claimed Senator Brandis had “misled” Parliament by saying Mr Gleeson was on-board with the changes.\n\nSenator Brandis released a statement to the media this afternoon, confirming Mr Gleeson had advised him of his intention to resign his office.\n\n“In the circumstances, Mr Gleeson’s resignation is the proper course of action for him to have taken, as his letter acknowledges,” Senator Brandis said.\n\n“I thank Mr Gleeson for his service as the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth and wish him well for the future.\n\n“I will immediately take steps to identify and recommend to the Cabinet a suitable person to be the next Solicitor-General. In the meantime, the Government will recommend to His Excellency the Governor-General the appointment of Mr Tom Howe PSM QC as the Acting Solicitor-General.”\n\nIn a powerful resignation letter to Senator Brandis, Mr Gleeson said he had come to the decision “with regret” but said his relationship with his colleague had been “irretrievably broken”. \n\nHe said the best interests of the Commonwealth could only be served “when its first and second Law Officers enjoy each other’s complete trust and confidence with a mutually respectful relationship”.\n\n“When such a relationship is irretrievably broken, as is the case here ... there must be some resolution to the impasse,” Mr Gleeson wrote.\n\n“In taking this step, I make it perfectly plain that my motivation is solely to further the best interests of the Commonwealth by enabling the restoration of a functional working relationship between the first and second law officers.\n\n“My decision does not amount to a withdrawal of my position I have taken in relation to matters of controversy between us, including before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee.”\n\nMr Gleeson wrote that he “rejected absolutely each and every attack and insinuation” upon himself and his office by Government members of Parliament.\n\nHe said the decision was unrelated to any finding the Senate Committee may make. \n\nThe Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee is due to present a report to the Senate on the issue by November 8. \n\nLabor, who have previously called on Senator Brandis to step down over the dispute, said the wrong lawyer had resigned. \n\nOpposition leader Bill Shorten tweeted the Turnbull government should “hang its head in shame” over Mr Gleeson’s resignation. \n\nShadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said Mr Gleeson’s resignation was a direct result of the Attorney-General’s “disgraceful treatment of Mr Gleeson and his office”. \n\nMr Dreyfus said Senator Brandis should be disciplined for his “reprehensible” conduct, claiming he had “pushed Mr Gleeson out of office to save his own skin”. \n\n“It is not Mr Gleeson who should have resigned today — it is Senator Brandis,” he said. \n\n“Since Senator Brandis’s move to destroy the independence of the office of Solicitor-General came to light, Mr Gleeson has conducted himself with dignity and respect at every turn.\n\n“The Commonwealth has lost from its service a great legal mind and one of the most experienced constitutional lawyers in this country as its most senior legal adviser.”\n\nDuring his tirade on Mr Gleeson’s treatment by the Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus also criticised senators Ian Macdonald and Barry O’Sullivan for playing their part in hounding Mr Gleeson during the committee hearing.\n\nHe said the “proper course of action” was now for Senator Brandis to resign. \n\n“Senator Brandis created this mess by his own hand ... the ‘proper course of action’ is for Senator Brandis to resign, today.\n\n“But it is clear Senator Brandis has no intention of resigning — Mr Turnbull must instead sack him.”\n\nShadow minister for employment, Brendan O’Connor, echoed the shadow attorney-general, tweeting: “Turnbull should have sacked AG not SG”.\n\nLabor’s Tony Burke tweeted: \n\n","standFirst":"JUSTIN Gleeson’s resignation as solicitor-general after a feud with the Attorney-General has infuriated Labor MPs, who say George Brandis should be sacked. \n\n","kicker":"Shock move","byline":"Danielle Le

Chris Waller confirmed on Monday that Winx will go for a spell immediately and then be set for a Sydney autumn campaign where the likely target is the $4 million Queen Elizabeth Stakes (2000m) at Royal Randwick during The Championships.\n\nRAY THOMAS: WHY WINX’S WIN IS THE GREATEST RUN HE’S SEEN\n\nTIMEFORM: WINX ECLIPSES LEGENDS MAKYBE DIVA, SUNLINE\n\nCOX PLATE: WHEN DAYLIGHT REALLY IS SECOND\n\nWaller released a statement explaining the reasons behind the decision not to continue Winx’s spring campaign to include the Group 1 $2 million Emirates Stakes (2000m) at Flemington on November 5.\n\n“The owners and I have jointly decided to spell Winx following her brilliant win in the William Hill Cox Plate (last) Saturday,’’ Waller said.\n\n“Serious consideration was given to running in the MacKinnon (now Emirates) Stakes in two weeks; however we have carefully deliberated on what is best for the horse as well as ensuring she spends a reasonable period in the spelling paddock.’’\n\nWinx extended her winning streak to 13 when she won the Cox Plate by a staggering eight lengths — the biggest margin ever in the race — and lifted her prizemoney to $9.34 million to be third on the all-time list of leading prizemoney earners.\n\nBut Waller has taken the conservative approach with a view to the Sydney autumn carnival and also the longevity of the mighty mare’s race career.\n\nWaller said although an autumn race program has not been determined the “most logical races” will make up her campaign with the Queen Elizabeth Stakes the obvious focus.\n\n“Other options such as travelling overseas and returning for a third Cox Plate in 2017 are also items the owners and I will discuss in the near future,’’ he continued.\n\n“She has pulled up well from the race with the exception of a minor abrasion to her hind leg.\n\n“Simple bathing and a trip or two to the beach would see it naturally heal; however I have taken the aggressive approach of treating it with antibiotics to ensure no risks are taken.’’\n\nWaller’s careful management of Winx is likely to extend her race career into her six-year-old season.\n\n“Longevity is the key for this mare as it will provide many more special moments over the next 12 months and beyond,’’ he said.\n\n“I really appreciate the admiration shown to her by racing fans and the public and it is an honour to share that experience with you all.’’\n\n","standFirst":"THE Flemington spring carnival will be without its greatest drawcard, with Winx to be sent to the spelling paddock.

familiar: a star of the game, arguably going into his prime, decides to leave one title contender for another.\n\nThat’s the situation Oklahoma City found themselves in when superstar Kevin Durant decided to join the star-studded Golden State Warriors, drawing direct comparisons to Patrick Dangerfield’s move to Geelong.\n\nThe Crows and the Thunder have both faced this situation heading into a new season with fans questioning if the team can survive without its star.\n\nJust as Adelaide had Rory Sloane waiting in the wings, Oklahoma City has a bona fide NBA superstar in Russell Westbrook.\n\nOften considered the “other guy” behind Durant, Westbrook has constantly shown he is more than capable of winning games on his own while Durant has been injured. He definitely can go above and beyond this year.\n\nBrisbane Lions = Chicago Bulls \n\nOne of the most annoying thing for fans of these teams is that both have had historically incredible periods of success. \n\nEven people who never followed the NBA know of the Bulls three-peats in the 90s with Michael Jordan, and Lions’ fans will never forget the glorious three-peat from 2001-2003 where they were kings of the AFL. \n\nHowever last season both teams failed to make the finals/playoffs and while the Lions are attempting to rebuild, the Bulls are a couple years ahead of them with some strong drafting. \n\nThe Bulls made some interesting veteran recruits in the off season — Dwyane Wade, Rajon Rondo, Robin Lopez — but their star draft pick Jimmy Butler is the leader of their team and they’ll be hoping more of their young talent in Bobby Portis, Nikola Mirotic and Doug McDermott can make a name for themselves.\n\nCarlton Blues = Boston Celtics\n\nA working class icon since their inceptions, both of these clubs have more trophies in their cabinets then you can shake a stick at.\n\nWhile the Blues and Celtics have taken very different paths to get to where they are now, they are in very similar positions.\n\nBoth have an energetic young coach and are heavily invested in youth. \n\nAnd while the Blues’ fans have struggled in the lower part of the ladder for a number of years, the Celtics’ will give them something to smile about, as they are expected to be a contender in the Eastern Conference this season.\n\nCollingwood Magpies = Dallas Mavericks\n\nIf we said to you that one of the most powerful men in the organisation was a media figurehead who seemed to be on television all the time, got in trouble for what he says and that the teams fans loved him, would you believe us if we said we weren’t talking about Eddie McGuire?\n\nJust as Collingwood has Eddie, Dallas has Marc Cuban. The multi-billionaire seems to be on TV way more than his team, but Eddie still wins due to sheer workload.\n\nDallas also has Australian Olympian and NBA Championship-winning centre Andrew Bogut on its roster, so there’s a hometown element to cheer for there. \n\nEssendon Bombers = Los Angeles Lakers\n\nIt has been dark times for these two high-profile teams.\n\nThe Lakers are an iconic franchise that ties the NBA record for most championships won in history, but has recently fallen on hard times, and finished last in their conference in 2016. \n\nWith the retirement of future hall of famer Kobe Bryant, the young Lakers will be looking to work their way back into relevance behind a young core, much like the Bombers are looking to do in 2017.\n\nPlayer comparison: Zac Merrett — D’Angelo Russell.\n\nFremantle Dockers = New Orleans Pelicans\n\nWhen it comes to teams with weird nicknames, Fremantle and New Orleans take the cake. They’re not ones that you only need to explain once.\n\nEach of the Dockers and Pelicans have arguably the greatest young player in the competition in Nat Fyfe and Anthony Davis, only problem is they both struggle to stay healthy for a whole season.\n\nIf Davis can stay healthy, the Pelicans will be a thorn in the side of many opponents.\n\nGeelong Cats = Golden State Warriors\n\nGeelong has had a long-run of recent success, and while they didn’t manage to go all the way last season, they did manage to recruit the best player in the competition in Patrick Dangerfield.\n\nThe Warriors have done the same with superstar forward, Kevin Durant. The MVP sharp shooter made the high-profile move from Oklahoma City to join the Dubs.\n\nJust as all eyes were on Danger, even more will be on KD this season, and see how damaging he can be alongside reigning MVP Stephen Curry. \n\nGWS Giants = Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nWith more top round draft picks then you can throw a stick at, the Timberwolves truly are the GWS of the NBA.\n\nWhile they’re a bit further back in their development, Minnesota’s young guard is proving to be a real handful for even the most experienced NBA teams.\n\nIf Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins can continue to build on strong career starts, don’t be surprised if the Timberwolves rocket up the standings in the west.\n\nNBA season preview: Record eight Australians set to take league by storm\n\nGold Coast = Houston Rockets\n\nTwo teams with best-in-the-competition calibre superstars in Gary Ablett Jnr and James Harden, but both have struggled to put successful talent around them to take the next step. This may be slightly harsh on the Rockets, who did make it to the Western Conference finals two seasons ago, but last year was viewed as a major disappointment for the franchise when they only just scraped into the playoffs.\n\nThe Rockets are set up to be one of the most exciting offensive teams this season under new coach Mike D’Antoni, and James Harden’s move to the point guard position will give him the opportunity to put up MVP-like numbers. \n\nHawthorn Hawks = San Antonio Spurs\n\nBoth these teams have one defining characteristic over the past couple of seasons, they win. They win, they win and then they win again.\n\nDespite numerous roster changes, both these teams are almost annoyingly consistent.\n\nThis is in part due to the legendary coaches at the helm of both teams. Alistair Clarkson has been instrumental to the Hawks recent success, Spurs coach Greg Popovich has spent 20 years building a dynasty in the Texas desert.\n\nBoth are known for being slightly short fused, but Clarko wins for putting his fist though an MCG wall. Also the Spurs have Aussie Boomers star Patty Mills, so there’s an added homegrown element to cheer for.\n\nMelbourne Demons = Milwaukee Bucks\n\nThe future is coming. That has been the mantra in Milwaukee for the past couple of seasons. Something which many Demons fans will say sounds strangely familiar.\n\nBut with their good mix of young talent and older leaders, the Bucks can make a push up the Eastern Conference standings.\n\nMatthew Dellavedova opens up on life ahead of his Milwaukee debut\n\nPlus they also have a rookie turning a lot of heads in Australia’s newest NBA phenom Thon Maker\n\nAlso they have Delly, you can’t go wrong with Delly. \n\nWhat are you most looking forward to this NBA season? Tell us in the comments below.\n\nNorth Melbourne Kangaroos = Miami Heat\n\nTwo teams that very quickly went from a who’s who to who’s that?\n\nBoth clubs will be going into next season without their longest serving players as Boomer Harvey and Dwayne Wade were moved on.\n\nWith the big name older players leaving, it’s time for the young brigade to step up and prove they’re good enough to do it on their own.\n\nPort Adelaide Power = Los Angeles Clippers\n\nPort Adelaide fans haven’t been able to enjoy much success in the past few years, but at their core they are a strong team who are still trying to find a way to retool before going back to the finals, rather than bottom out. \n\nThe Clippers unfortunately find themselves in a difficult position, in the same Western Conference as the Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs, but they are hoping that another year with a very similar roster and stronger team chemistry will help them find a way to break through.\n\nBlake Griffin started hot last year before he missed most of second half of the season with injury, and the Clippers will be hoping he can recapture his form along with Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan, on the way for a further playoff push.\n\nRichmond Tigers = New York Knicks\n\nThe Knicks are one of the most popular franchises in the country, but have failed to have any legitimate success in over 40 years. They are always overhyped, being a big market team — but usually fail to live up to expectations. \n\nA couple of years ago, they made the playoffs, but since that time have fallen back into the bottom half of the Eastern Conference, much to the fans’ dismay.\n\nSound familiar, Tigers fans? \n\nThe good news in they’ve brought in some big names: MVP Derrick Rose and Joakim Noah will slot into their starting line-up along with star forward Carmello Anthony and young stud Kristaps Porzingis. \n\nThe potential is there Tigers’ fans, build up your expectations, just don’t be surprised if the Knicks crash and burn again this season like they have in the past. \n\nSt. Kilda Saints = Orlando Magic \n\nThe Orlando Magic are a young team with a long championship drought. In 2009, their star centre Dwight Howard took them all the way to the Finals, but they couldn’t get over the line, much like the Saints in 2010 against Collingwood.\n\nThe Magic made some odd moves this off-season, but they’ve acquired a lot of big man talent, and a new head coach in Frank Vogel, who has proven playoff form.\n\nThey may not be a chance to contend this season, but this could be a fun team to watch with new recruit Serge Ibaka and high-flying forward Aaron Gordon providing plenty of highlights. \n\nSydney Swans = Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nA powerhouse of the league, the Cleveland Cavaliers have the highest payroll in the NBA, and brought back hometown hero and superstar LeBron James two years ago, who delivered a championship to ‘the Land’ in the 2016 season.\n\nSydney has COLA, effectively giving them one of the highest payrolls in the AFL, and brought in superstar Lance Franklin on a big-money contract two years ago, hoping it will bring them another premiership.\n\nThe Cavs are a constant title contender with James, much like Sydney, who continue to find a way to go deep into the AFL finals campaign. \n\nThe Cavs lost in 2015, before defeating the Warriors last season in a thrilling NBA Finals to win the championship, could the Swans do the same next year?\n\nWestern Bulldogs = Indiana Pacers\n\nAll the fans of the newly crowned AFL premiers can rest easy now your premiership drought is over, and instead shift their focus to a team that not many people in the NBA are talking about who have the potential to be a surprise packet this NBA season.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers have quietly retooled their roster to bring in some very savvy NBA veterans to complement some of their already strong roster.\n\nPaul George is the unquestionable leader and star, but he now will have great help from point guard Jeff Teague, another forward to help down low in Thaddeus Young, and some bench scoring in big man Al Jefferson.\n\nJump on now Bulldogs fans, because this could be a team that could go a long way in the Eastern Conference come playoffs time.\n\nWest Coast Eagles = Toronto Raptors\n\nThe Raptors are sometimes the forgotten team in the NBA because they are the only team outside of the United States. West Coast has a tendency to also go under the radar to many Melbourne footy fans, but always find a way to make their way back to the finals.\n\nThe Raptors made it all the way to the Eastern Conference finals last season, before getting knocked out by the champion Cavaliers.\n\nWest Coast were bundled out of the finals last season by the eventual premiers, the Western Bulldogs. There’s no doubt that both teams will be looking to come back and make amends in coming seasons.\n\nDon’t follow an AFL team? Utah Jazz \n\nIf you aren’t an AFL fan, but are looking for someone to follow this year? Or don’t agree with our team comparison for your AFL side? Get on the Utah Jazz bandwagon. \n\nThe Jazz are quietly being touted as the team in the west that will have a big leap this season, with a very deep and talented roster.\n\nThey also have two Australians on the team, in young guard Dante Exum and veteran Joe Ingles, so show some Aussie pride and back our boys as the Jazz make the leap into the playoffs. \n\nWhat do you think of our NBA / AFL comparisons? Did we get it right?

still hopes to be allowed to ride at Saturday’s Victoria Derby meeting despite the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal finding him guilty of reckless riding. \n\nVCAT vice-president Judge Pamela Jenkins is hearing submissions on penalty on Monday with Oliver hoping to have his 20-meeting suspension reduced. \n\nOliver was outed over his ride on eventual winner Flying Artie in the Blue Sapphire Stakes on October 12, when he angled out from behind the leader and made heavy contact with the horse to his outside. \n\nThe judge said Oliver’s actions were calculated and intentional, and had created a clear circumstance of potential risk. \n\n“In my view, the applicant exhibited a cavalier attitude, which is not moderated by his explanation to the effect that jockeys will commonly try to take another horse out, notwithstanding the rules,” Jenkins said. \n\n“The applicant, as a very experienced professional jockey, is aware of the attendant dangers of placing another jockey at risk of falling and the consequential danger to other riders and horses where a fall occurs in front of a field of riders. \n\n“By forcing his mount into the pathway of another jockey and abruptly displacing that jockey and his mount out of the way, the applicant displayed a reckless indifference to the possible grave consequences.” \n\nJenkins said Oliver displayed a cavalier attitude to the rules of racing, the paramount objectives of which were to ensure the safety of horse and rider. \n\n“If riders continue to test the boundaries in the hope of defying the clear and attendant risks associated with a particular course of action, then the integrity of the rules are undermined and the safety of riders and horses alike become victims of the pursuit of competitive advantage.” Oliver needs his suspension cut from 20 to 17 meetings to allow him to ride on Saturday, when he has rides booked on Flying Artie in the Group 1 Coolmore Stud Stakes and Highlad in the Group 1 Victoria Derby. \n\nJenkins will hand down her decision on the penalty at 11.30am on Tuesday.\n\n","standFirst":"CHAMPION jockey Damien Oliver has lost a bid to downgrade his reckless riding charge with a

are tiptoeing to the end of a long, teetering walk down the tightrope of being a VCE bystander, carer, wingman or woman.\n\nIt’s a fine balancing act and one that can feel as if you’re doing it 20 storeys up in a blindfold and the wind is blowing. Hard.\n\nYou feel quite helpless and, at the same time, desperate to do something to help your loved young person get through what they and we are constantly told should not “define you”, but due to our system of letting kids into courses based on a number, they feel really does.\n\nYou know all you can do is maybe pick them up from school a bit more often to help them get to their desks quicker, feed them up well and regularly, nag them into bed after its too late for them to really be taking anything in and keep an eye on their mood.\n\nYou go to the parent info evenings, you take notes when the nice “study habits” expert comes to explain how plans, schedules and efficient note summaries work, but you know the kids have been told exactly the same information and the idea of sitting down with an 18-year-old and babying them through the finer points of revision, uninvited, is ridiculous.\n\nThere are some parents, we’re told, who go to the point of not just reading all their kids’ VCE texts but virtually doing the work alongside them, and if you’re on the highly strung or obsessive side this could be tempting for the reassurance/insurance value — but I don’t think it’s healthy.\n\nEven so, while some may hardly feel the VCE stress, bless them, like many other parents, I don’t come from that gene pool.\n\nI don’t consider myself a helicopter parent or a cottonwool type. I’ve tried to let all my children make mistakes — even with subject choices — and learn from them, and I don’t live their lives for them.\n\nI shoot for attentive without being intrusive or suffocating. I want the kids to know I am 100 per cent solidly there for them but won’t do their lifting.\n\nI’ve let them recover from their own disappointments, the test they didn’t do as well as they’d hoped, the team they didn’t make, and seen it help them build resilience.\n\nI’ve learned you can be hands off to a level that’s good for them (and you) but you can’t not care.\n\nWhen someone you love so much has something large hanging over them that, like it or not, does hold the key to their future hopes at least to a point, you wish it could be you suffering through all that uncertainty, the nerves, that general claustrophobic atmosphere the poor things live through for about nine months.\n\nIt takes about the same time to bake a fully formed VCE kid as it took to gestate him or her 17 or 18 years earlier. And unless you’re really unlucky with pregnancy I’d say that journey is infinitely easier.\n\nIt’s not just the wanting, hoping and wishing your special young person to do well enough to get into their chosen course that wrenches the heart strings of parents during VCE. It’s the underlying knowledge, I think, that this is their last real developmental stage in which you as a parent will be intimately involved.\n\nAfter pregnancy and the labour you’re rewarded with a shiny new beginning, the start of a long and lovely adventure with a fresh love of your life. After VCE, if your child crosses that bridge successfully you know you are on the way to having to let go.\n\nYou know deep down that this year is your mutual destination in the long trip you have taken together from when they were a dribbling and divine three-year-old, into kinder.\n\nYou can’t escape the significance.\n\nYou don’t want to fall at the last school-parent hurdle, and yet you know you can’t run ahead of theirs, lowering them to an easy height.\n\nIt’s a happy-sad year where time seems to stretch out in the first half and every SAC test feels like anticipating a trip to the dentist, then snaps back and seems to run too fast in the countdown to the end.\n\nDoing some of the last few school runs for my eldest son, I’ve watched bunches of those lanky, healthy young people full of potential as they lope towards the school gates to go to their last few classes.\n\nHooked up to music and looking faintly ridiculous as grown men and women still sporting school uniforms, they seem lost in worlds of their own — a shared limbo between being a kid inside a system and stepping off into their great unknown.\n\nNo doubt, wafting invisibly behind them is the same tailwind of love I silently send along with the adored VCE guy of my very own.\n\n* Keep in touch with Wendy via @wtuohyor at facebook.com/WendyATuohy\n\n","standFirst":"ABOUT 100,000 parents who’ve been wingmen and women for VCE kids this year are nearing the end of a long trek, Wendy Tuohy knows how you feel.\n\n","kicker":"VCE Parents","byline":"WENDY TUOHY","commentsAllowed":false,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":false,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["WENDY TUOHY"],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":[]},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":{"value":"780ba8d6143e8c3602297a15bd09a876","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/content/v2/780ba8d6143e8c3602297a15bd09a876"},"originId":"d943795e-9984-11e6-ab69-22cb8f6501a3","origin":"METHODE","channel":"NONE","title":"Why Melbourne winter just won’t quit","subtitle":"Melbourne weather: Why winter conditions are lasting into spring","description":"ENJOY this spell of warmish weather while you can.

a long, cool and wet spring so far, Melbourne is set for a sunny top of 18C today and 24C tomorrow.\n\nBut Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Richard Carlyon says an approaching cold front will cool things off again, with another due ahead of next week’s Melbourne Cup.\n\n“It looks like being a drier week this week but it won’t be warming up in a hurry either,” he said.\n\n“Today will be mild across the state and tomorrow will be quite mild, but then there is some cooler weather into the middle part of the week with a few showers mainly in the south, and then some dry days on Friday and Saturday. In fact, Saturday looks like the pick of the week.”\n\nMr Carlyon said a front due overnight tomorrow is weak but will lower temperatures.\n\n“We’re not likely to have severe weather warnings for damaging winds and it’s not likely to exacerbate the flood situation we’ve got,” he said.\n\nMelbourne’s maximum will drop back to 20C on Wednesday and 17C on Thursday, with showers possible on both days, before the sun returns with a top of 20C on Friday.\n\nSaturday looks sunny with a maximum of 24C at this stage – perfect for racegoers at Flemington.\n\nA stronger cold front expected on Sunday should plunge Victoria back towards winter once again, Mr Carlyon said.\n\nWhat’s behind out cool spring so far?\n\n“Spring is normally unsettled but normally you get a bit of heat involved as well,” Mr Carlyon said.\n\n“We haven’t had too much warm weather. We just haven’t had any lengthy dry breaks. Spring is changeable but we have just had more of the cold, wet part of spring than anything else so far.”\n\nMr Carlyon warned that relief is a while away yet.\n\n“At least for the next week, it looks like more of the same because quite an active front is moving through on Sunday that will bring that cold, wet and windy weather back to the state,” he said.\n\n“There’s certainly no sign of drier or warmer conditions developing, I guess more like temperatures that you’d expect this time of year. It just looks like another active front that will bring up cold air from the southwest.”\n\nColder temperatures have persisted well into October. Saturday’s maximum, 13.2C, was the lowest October maximum since 2010 and the lowest recorded in the second half of the month since 2003.\n\nMr Carlyon says in terms of rainfall, he expects “a swag of records will fall” when statistics are tallied at the end of the month.\n\n“And coupled with a wet, cold September, I would expect our spring to have been a cold one, but we will have to see what happens,” he said.\n\n","standFirst":"SATURDAY was the coldest late October day in Melbourne for 13 years. So it got us wondering, why is it still so miserable and are we about to see a bunch of rain records fall?\n\n","kicker":"Weather watch","byline":"Jamie Duncan","commentsAllowed":true,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":true,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["Jamie Duncan"],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":["<a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/features/spring-racing-carnival/cox-plate-best-pictures-of-the-day/image-gallery/3a53ae3fa0ae8a0f756de29c6f7699ca\">Wet and wild: Weather has a field day at Cox Plate</a>"]},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":{"value":"1ca1ebd085445780e9f651e65b27b98f","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/content/v2/1ca1ebd085445780e9f651e65b27b98f"},"originId":"fc3cd492-9825-11e6-90f6-b8531e8f57b9","origin":"METHODE","channel":"WEB","title":"It’s extraordinary to be this average","subtitle":"Katie Bice: It’s extraordinary to be this average","description":"BEING ordinary has become seriously unfashionable.

told to dream of a life less ordinary. But why can’t we just be happy with being like everyone else?\n\nThe harsh reality is that most of us will never be anything more than that. We can tell our kids they’re “special” all we want, but just look in the schoolyard and you’ll see they’re exactly like the other 300 kids there.\n\nThe idea seems to be that we have to be “someone” for our lives to be worthwhile; and that when we compare ourselves with those worthy types we always come off second best.\n\nYou don’t have to be exceptional to do and achieve good things, yet it’s hard not to be drawn into the silliness of trying to be something more. Last week I read a story about a man who had spoken to 50 strangers. He found the experience profound and was struck by the ability of every one of them to remember the conversation that changed their life.\n\nAfter recovering from the reeling horror I felt at the prospect of chatting to that many strangers, I tried to recall what discussion had changed my life.\n\nAnything in my childhood was immediately out since I seem to have suppressed the whole thing.\n\nSo the next obvious thing was meeting my husband. It was at an AFL Grand Final party some time after the invention of the internet but blessedly before Tinder.\n\nMy two housemates and I wandered in the dark towards the pub on the corner to replenish our beer supply.\n\n“So do you like him?” they inquired.\n\n“Ahhh, I don’t know,” I replied truthfully.\n\n“Because he definitely likes you.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“For sure.”\n\nDeep, hey?\n\nDesperate to find anything more meaningful to hang my hat on, I skipped forward a few weeks to the moment I knew we could just be right for each other. It was easy to remember because we had both laughed until we cried ... about his mate’s cat without a tail.\n\nBut remembering that moment was the point I abandoned my quest to be philosophical, more intellectually sophisticated. I had to face facts: I’m plain ordinary.\n\nI live a normal, delightfully dull existence in which I work too much, party too little, whittle away precious hours on Real Housewives and cooking shows and rarely worry about the thoughts of anyone outside my small circle of friends.\n\nIt won’t win me a Nobel Peace Prize, I’ll never be Australian of the Year — but I’m content with being Mrs Average. And I can’t work out why a bunch of other people want me feel bad about it. Or why so many people strive to be something more.\n\nI’m supposed to be “mindful” when I’m still not even sure what that means. \n\nI’m meant to be having Shakespeare-worthy discussions on the universe and humanity when all I really want to do is make fun of my mates, have them do the same at me and tell old, dumb stories.\n\nWhen you think about it, us ordinary folk sure have a lot going for us.\n\nWant your rubbish picked up, your kids taught, your garden mowed, your truck and train driven? You can rely on Mr and Mrs Smith.\n\nWe are always the ones who dig in when the chips are down.\n\nNeed sandbags filled, money for bushfire victims, help at the school sausage sizzle — the Joe Citizens will be there.\n\nWhere are the others? Probably mindfully working on their adult colouring books.\n\nKATIE BICE IS THE SUNDAY HERALD SUN DEPUTY EDITOR\n\nkatie.bice@news.com.au\n\n@ktbice\n\n","standFirst":"PEOPLE spend so much time striving to be “special” that they miss the simple pleasure of being average, a useful, content member of the pack, writes Katie Bice.\n\n","kicker":"Ordinary people","byline":"Katie Bice","commentsAllowed":true,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":true,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["Katie Bice"],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":[]},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":{"value":"f1fbafb7e4cdecc73569ac01863f1e31","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/content/v2/f1fbafb7e4cdecc73569ac01863f1e31"},"originId":"b744a670-9830-11e6-90f6-b8531e8f57b9","origin":"METHODE","channel":"WEB","title":"Senator shoots himself in the foot","subtitle":"Peta Credlin: Senator Leyonhjelm shoots himself in the foot","description":"IT is ironic that after a whole week talking about the Adler A110 lever-action shotgun, Tony Abbott is still the prime minister who banned it.

not going to make it a habit to detail internal debates inside the Abbott government.\n\nBut Australia’s gun laws are too important an issue to stay silent.\n\nAnd despite Senator David Leyonhjelm’s tweet this week that I should “STFU” (shut the f--- up), I will not. \n\nADLER SHOTGUN: AUSTRALIAN STATES FAIL TO REACH A DEAL ON ACCESS\n\nHUNTERS, FARMERS SAY GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES HIJACKING DEBATE OVER BANNED SHOTGUN\n\n(No I am not kidding; hardly an intelligent comeback for a 64-year-old elected official).\n\nIn July last year, the Abbott government became aware that a new type of shotgun was on its way to Australia. Already over 7000 orders had been placed with the first of the seven-shot lever-action guns due to clear Customs in late August. \n\nTo put this into perspective, if Tony Abbott hadn’t acted, these new Adler A110 guns would have almost doubled the number of shotguns in Australia in one fell swoop.\n\nAs Mr Abbott said last week, law enforcement agencies expressed concern that without a tougher classification, the mass importation of this new type of lever-action weapon would be dangerous at a time of heightened threat. \n\nFront of mind was the reality that the weapon used at the Lindt Cafe siege in Sydney’s CBD was a common shotgun. \n\nNew guns, with greater capacity, more brutal efficiency and poorly classified, were a dumb idea at a difficult time. This information is in the public domain. I do not comment on National Security Committee discussions.\n\nSo on Thursday, July 23, last year, Mr Abbott agreed to put a temporary ban on the importation of the Adler A110 seven-shot shotgun, with the Justice Minister to implement it via regulation. \n\nThe ban was designed to be temporary, with a sunset clause so that it would dovetail into the government’s review of the National Firearms Agreement due to report in early 2016. \n\nThis review into the system we use to classify the weapons that can be bought and used by individuals in our community was a key recommendation of the government’s report into the Lindt Cafe siege. \n\nMr Abbott hoped to see the Adler reclassified down from Class A (which gave lots of people ready access) to Class D — the toughest class, essentially limiting it to law enforcement agencies and professional shooters.\n\nThe news of the ban was broken by Samantha Maiden in this newspaper on Sunday, July 26. She reported that the Abbott government would ban the Adler firearm for “at least six months until the National Firearms Agreement review process was completed”.\n\nMr Abbott argued strongly that we had enough guns in this country to do the job farmers and others needed to be done. If there was a case for the Adler A110, then it would have to come in under a tougher classification with greater safeguards. \n\nMr Abbott was not anti-gun; he was just against a big spike in our importation of guns at a time when our community was battling the risk of lone-wolf attacks.\n\nClaims last week of a secret deal between Tony Abbott and Senator Leyonhjelm to slip these guns into Australia as the price for a vote in the Senate are therefore rubbish.\n\nEven Senator Leyonhjelm was forced to admit he didn’t have a deal with Tony Abbott because there was no meeting, no phone call, no correspondence, no communication. \n\nFor the record, there was nothing between Senator Leyonhjelm and me either. The story then was that he had a deal with ministers Peter Dutton and Michael Keenan and emails were produced as “proof”.\n\nBut here’s where the chronology is instructive.\n\nIf Senator Leyonhjelm is to be believed, he had a “secret” deal with minister Dutton and Keenan to get a 12-month review of the Adler gun for the price of his vote during negotiations about unrelated legislation in mid-August 2015. \n\nBut we now know that Tony Abbott had already found the problem, sought advice, agreed to a temporary ban, worked with his minister to deal with it by regulation change and announced it in the Sunday papers three weeks earlier.\n\nSo this week, the Coalition lost time fighting about a so-called secret deal with ministers last year that was neither a deal (because it was what Abbott decided weeks earlier) nor secret (it was splashed across every Sunday paper in the country). Was anyone in the PM’s office kept in the loop as Malcolm Turnbull claimed on Senator Leyonhjelm’s “deal”? \n\nI don’t know, as advisers often received hundreds of emails a day, and a cc’d note hardly constitutes “in full knowledge”. But then again, it hardly matters — Senator Leyonhjelm’s so-called “secret deal” was what Mr Abbott had announced by way of the Sunday papers three weeks earlier.\n\nThe story most journalists missed this week was that Prime Minister Turnbull himself kicked off this issue on Tuesday morning by failing to rule out trading votes on guns to secure Senator Leyonhjelm’s vote on the current ABCC legislation. And it wasn’t just one question either.\n\nBy refusing to rule out a deal with the Senator, the PM left the door wide open, an activist Labor Opposition pounced and the rest of the week was Adlerised.\n\nMalcolm Turnbull tried his best to mop it up but Senator Leyonhjelm confirmed on Wednesday night’s Sky News Bolt Report that he was indeed working with Turnbull Government ministers to cut a deal to get the Adler gun into the country for the price of his ABCC vote. \n\nHe didn’t say he had a deal but he named the ministers in discussions. Was there a deal pending or did the government merely want Senator Leyonhjelm to think he would get one?\n\nDespite the huffing and puffing of the Liberal Democratic Party’s front man, the Australian people will never support more liberal gun laws. \n\nAlmost every day there’s a new story from the US about the impact of gun culture on the lives of people just going about their ordinary lives: in shopping malls, in cinemas, on university campuses and in primary schools.\n\nI’m a country girl so I have lived with guns much of my life but I also went to high school in California. I understand the desire of so many Americans who wish they could wind back the clock on the Second Amendment of their Constitution but now fear their weapon obsession has gone too far to fix.\n\nFor them, it is over. For us, it is not.\n\nThe Canberra games over guns last week might have been sport for the political types, but for the rest of us, we want a careful balance between licensed and registered users, and safe streets and communities.\n\nThis should never be a hard choice for any prime minister. It certainly wasn’t for Tony Abbott and I don’t think it will be for Malcolm Turnbull.\n\n","standFirst":"IT is ironic that after a whole week talking about the Adler A110 lever-action shotgun, Tony

marks three years since Ms Murphy-West’s body was found at her Pakenham home, her toddler son Noah nearby.\n\nPolice later concluded Ms Murphy-West was murdered before her killer tried to manipulate the crime scene to give the appearance of a suicide. \n\nANDREW RULE: CAUGHT IN A HELL SHE COULDN’T ESCAPE\n\nHer boyfriend, Troy Boothey, is the man police suspect but has never been charged.\n\nInvestigators have sent a brief of evidence to the State Coroner, potentially meaning the case will go before an inquest.\n\nMs Murphy-West’s family say that if they can’t get justice for her yet, they want answers.\n\nThey have long suspected a second person was involved in trying to give the appearance Ms Murphy-West had taken her own life and that others are withholding information to protect the killer.\n\nHer mother, Paula Murphy, said she wanted to see those people answering hard questions about what they knew.\n\n“They’re not up at night with Noah when he’s crying. They don’t take him down to his mother’s gravestone,” she said.\n\n“They need to face what has happened. This will never go away for us and they’ve just gone on living their lives.”\n\nMs Murphy said Noah, four, who she is now raising, was a loving, affectionate boy, but he could not yet comprehend what had happened.\n\n“He just doesn’t get it and we can’t explain it properly,” she said.\n\n“I’m getting questions like ‘why can’t I have a sleepover at my other mum’s’?”\n\nMs Murphy said a person capable of killing her daughter had the capacity to do the same again and had to be stopped.\n\nShe said the past three years had been terribly difficult, but giving up was never an option.\n\n“I haven’t given up. I’m trying to keep the faith,” Ms Murphy said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the coroner said evidence provided to them was now being ­reviewed before a decision was made on what happened next.\n\nmark.buttler@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"A MELBOURNE mum prays an inquest will finally give her answers three years after her daughter’s body was found next to her toddler son.\n\n","kicker":"Murder inquest","byline":"Mark Buttler","commentsAllowed":false,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":false,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["Mark Buttler"],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":[]},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":{"value":"d5d58018d83183f9b139185bb521e39d","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/content/v2/d5d58018d83183f9b139185bb521e39d"},"originId":"2b9b3b30-9811-11e6-90f6-b8531e8f57b9","origin":"METHODE","channel":"WEB","title":"Caught in a hell she couldn’t escape","subtitle":"Andrew Rule: Three years after Maddy Murphy-West’s death, her family still suffers","description":"IT IS three years today since Maddison Murphy-West was found dead in her unit in Pakenham.

anyone thinks the abused young mother died by her own hand, although that’s how it was presented to the police called to the scene by her violent, drug-dealing, thieving boyfriend, Troy Boothey.\n\nBoothey, then 24, told the police he had come in from doing something in the garage to find his partner of four years hanging from a doorknob.\n\nThe investigators doubted his story, despite his crocodile tears. They suspected the scene had been dressed up to look like suicide. Nothing has happened in the three years since to change their minds or those of the dead woman’s family.\n\nMum prays for answers to daughter Maddy Murphy-West’s violent death\n\nFor Boothey, his girlfriend’s violent death did not seem to divert him from a life of crime. Later the same day, instantly recovered, he was seen scoring drugs at Seaford. When someone he knew asked him how Maddy was, he lied: “Great!”\n\nThey say the leopard’s spots never vanish — they just get bigger or smaller. This week Troy Boothey appeared in Dandenong Drug Court charged with the latest of a lifetime of offences.\n\nHe admitted thefts and having illicit drugs after he was caught red-handed robbing a Dandenong South auction house in early August.\n\nHe was carrying a torch and nine grams of the drug ice after he and an accomplice had broken in by cutting a fence and smashing a window.\n\nThree months earlier, in June, police found Boothey asleep in a car in Hampton Park, engine running and headlights on. The car was unregistered and Boothey had ecstasy pills, scales and $450 cash on him.\n\nIn the sick and selfish world of Boothey and thousands like him, cash is for necessities like drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and gambling — not to be wasted on registering cars, paying rent, buying real food or supporting children. \n\nVictorian courts are clogged with crimes which are symptoms of the same sort of sordid circumstances: drugs, drinking, chronic unemployment, stupidity, criminal carelessness and more drugs. Which, of course, is just another variation on the circumstances leading to the death of the neglected toddler Jaidyn Leskie at Moe in 1997.\n\nIf Jaidyn’s body had been found the night he died, instead of being successfully hidden for six months, it would have been just another sad case to be tutted over and then forgotten.\n\n“Just another little murder,” as Phil Cleary reflects bitterly of the pre-planned butchering of his sister Vicki by a violent piece of vermin called Peter Keogh in 1987. \n\nKeogh, notoriously, was let off with a pathetically light jail sentence by a judge who should have known better than to humour the defence case of “provocation”.\n\nMaddy Murphy-West, like Vicki Cleary and hundreds more, think they can change bad and damaged people — nearly always drunks or druggies with criminal “form” — into someone who can be trusted with their own lives and their children’s. We all know (or know of) someone like that.\n\nPatting monsters doesn’t work, a point Maddy Murphy-West’s mother and uncle have had too much time to think about since they got the awful news three years ago.\n\nA month after Maddy’s death, Boothey cut off a bus driver at a Hallam roundabout, got out of his car with a baseball bat and smashed the bus window, spattering shattered glass into the driver’s face.\n\nA dash camera recorded the incident and Boothey was arrested soon after, identified by his mugshot. \n\nHe could offer no reason for the attack — and claimed he could not even remember it — but in his defence it was suggested he was lashing out wildly because of his “grief” over Maddy’s death. The same excuse, incidentally, he used for various other offences.\n\nHe was either lying about not recalling the attack — or so off his face on drugs that his mind was blanked out. \n\nEither way, he deserved the four months’ jail he got. And more.\n\nOne way he could have proven his bona fides as a grief-stricken partner was to keep his promise to detectives to go through with a polygraph lie-detector test.\n\nBut — surprise, surprise — he didn’t. \n\nMaddy Murphy-West had reasons to want to escape her life with Boothey but, insist her family and friends, she would never have killed herself.\n\nShe loved Noah too much. Her mother, Paula Murphy, has always believed that her daughter’s renewed determination to leave Boothey might have sparked an ugly confrontation before her death.\n\n“People told her to pack her bags and leave and that was a mistake — she should have walked straight out the door without packing anything,” Paula Murphy once told this reporter. \n\n“I told her once to just go out to buy milk and never come back.”\n\nMaddy’s death is all the harder for her mother because she had often tried to persuade her girl to leave the fated relationship. \n\nBut Maddy wouldn’t — even after being separated for six months early in the year she died, she had stuck by the jailbird boyfriend. Her family still believe she was too frightened to do anything else.\n\nThe day before she was to reunite with him after he got out of jail in 2013, Maddy looked sick with strain. No wonder. The year before, she had been admitted to hospital after being brutally attacked.\n\nIn texts to a friend, she confessed she had been choked in front of her little boy. The texts, sent from Casey Hospital in Berwick in late 2012, admit she was waiting on results of neck scans after being half-strangled.\n\nShe was clearly afraid that her attacker would be angry about her going to police.\n\n“So now he’s going to kill me,” she texted. “I’m not only doing this for me and Noah, I’m doing it for him. He bashed me, choked me today. I can’t have that in front of my son.”\n\nHer fear was clear in the exchange during her day-long hospital stay.\n\n“If he calls you, don’t tell him anything. Not even about me being in hospital,” she wrote.\n\nBut she went back. It seemed to her she had no choice but to wade back into the quicksand she knew was going to choke her.\n\nWhen Boothey left prison last January, Maddy’s aunt, Kelly Anne Murphy, took to Facebook to express her anger and concern.\n\n“The prime suspect in Maddy’s murder is being released from prison tomorrow,” she wrote.\n\n“I’m warning everyone because it’s not just us that are in danger, he is a danger to the community as well. Our justice system has a lot to answer for!”\n\nTroy Boothey is only 27. How many more lives will he destroy before he destroys himself?\n\nandrew.rule@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"HARDLY anyone thinks abused young mother Maddison Murphy-West died by her own hand, but

Bill Brownless and Tim Watson formed the original breakfast crew, making their debut on the Monday morning after David Hookes hit his head after an altercation outside the Beaconsfield Hotel and died.\n\nNow Lyon is set to return to the same timeslot, with Channel 7’s Hamish McLachlan earmarked as a potential on-air partner. \n\nJORDAN LEWIS: I’M HAPPY, DON’T FEEL SORRY FOR ME\n\nSUPERCOACH 2017: STARS TO MAKE IMPACT IN NEW COLOURS\n\nFAILED TRADE: GIBBS FAMILY HAD THEIR HOPES UP\n\nMcLachlan is yet to commit to the station’s plan for a makeover of on-air talent.\n\nA Lyon-McLachlan pairing could see David Schwarz return to the drive slot in which he previously formed a successful partnership with Mark Allen. \n\nAllen is currently paired with Daniel Harford, a name that has cropped up as a possibility to join the breakfast crew at racing station RSN.\n\nLyon’s name has been linked with a series of possibilities: Fox Footy, Seven and Channel 9.\n\nMcLachlan has also been earmarked as a caller by SEN, with an obvious vacancy existing should Anthony Hudson accept an offer to join rival 3AW.\n\nMclachlan is also in the running to replace Dennis Cometti as Seven’s Friday night partner for Bruce McAvaney.\n\nThe station is waiting for the release of next year’s fixture before announcing its line-up.\n\nJames Brayshaw is said to have placed a call to Seven bosses, sounding out the possibility of calling football next year, with Brayshaw having told friends he doesn’t expect to have a heavy cricket schedule this summer.\n\nCould that mean he won’t be part of Nine’s summer of cricket team, a team that will welcome the polarising presence of Michael Clarke next month?\n\nANSWERED, SHANE\n\nSHANE Watson was diplomatic when asked by MC Neil Mitchell about his relationship with Michael Clarke during the week at a CPA luncheon at Crown Casino. \n\nRather than respond with kind to having been referred to as a “tumour in Australian cricket”, Watson basically played a straight bat, other than suggesting if given the chance he would happily nominate Clarke for Neale Daniher’s annual Big Freeze at the MCG. \n\nAnd if the Big Freeze was suddenly transferred to the Antarctic? \n\nDon’t think Watson would be too fussed if Clarke had to brave those rather more severe elements.\n\nROOS FOR UN?\n\n3AW breakfast host Ross Stevenson jokingly suggested on Friday that Paul Roos had been approached by the United Nations as a late replacement for Ban Ki-moon when he steps down in December. \n\nStevenson’s point was it’s about the only role Roos hasn’t been linked with, such is the respect with which he is held. \n\nAnd while the UN obviously won’t be happening, don’t discount him from a role with Fox Footy who have targeted Roos and Channel 7’s Matthew Pavlich as ideal talent for next year.\n\nNO COACHING FOR SHANE\n\nSHANE Warne, who was busy during the week at an opening of an Advanced Hair Studio in Dubai, becomes further removed from Australian cricket as our direction becomes dictated more and more by sports scientists. \n\nWarne has privately expressed the view that Australian cricket is being ruined by such types, and knows he will not be a coach at national level in the near future. \n\nThe story goes he was approached to become involved with the national Twenty20 team, but was then told it couldn’t happen because he hadn’t acquired the appropriate level of coaching accreditation. \n\nPICK A WINNER\n\nTHERE aren’t too many worse feelings in racing than being the underbidder on a future champion. \n\nTo date I’ve met five who should have bought So You Think, and triple Carlton-Premiership player Jimmy Buckley was a genuine underbidder when future champion two-year-old Rancher sold for $5000 in 1981. \n\nThen there is Bill Cockram, who in 2014 fell in love with a Myboycharlie filly but was outbid when Ciaron Maher paid $130,000 for the yearling. \n\nTo Cockram’s credit he found Maher after the sale and asked could he buy into the filly, one that has since won $3.67 million in prizemoney, not to mention her stud value. \n\nThe horse? Caulfield Cup winner Jameka.\n\nCOACHING CHANGES\n\nTHE days of Victorian Amateur Football Association clubs lacking a ruthless edge would seem well gone judging by the reaction of some well performed grand finalists. \n\nIt starts in A Grade where Old Xavierians upset the odds (again) to win the flag before promptly parting ways with joint coaches Ted Woodruff and Pat Hawkins, replacing them with former Melbourne and GWS player James “Junior” McDonald. \n\nDrop down a few grades and the same scenario in D1, where Old Geelong Premiership coach Jon Knight has made way for triple Old Xavierians A grade coach Nick Bourke. \n\n","standFirst":"ANDO’S SHOUT: TROUBLED AFL personality Garry Lyon is set to return to Melbourne’s airwaves and could be joined by Hamish McLachlan.\n\n","kicker":"Fallen

Boyd finally feels he belongs at AFL level, breakthrough Grand Final premiership performance","userOriginUpdated":"cusicks","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Tom-Boyd-finally-feels-he-belongs-at-AFL-level-as-he-can-match-it-physically-with-senior-opponents","revision":3,"body":"Boyd was one of the matchwinners for the Bulldogs in the drought-breaking premiership victory, starring with three goals from 14 disposals and eight marks playing up forward and in the ruck.\n\nMuch maligned throughout the season and in his first two years as a Bulldog after his high-profile switch from GWS to the Whitten Oval, Boyd has quietly been going about his business and developing his body for the rigours of AFL football.\n\nWhile his hefty price tag has generated the most attention, Boyd’s hard work in the gym and on the training track to become a versatile big man is finally paying off and earning him attention of a different kind.\n\n“Over the last pre-season increasing my running power (was a focus) and being my third year in the AFL I’m starting to feel like physically and aerobically I’m really matching it with the players that I’ve got to deal with,” Boyd said. “There are a lot of older backmen still playing in the league.\n\n“That was the main thing, getting myself to a level of conditioning so I could compete week to week.\n\n“I suppose from a consistency point of view it’s probably been my best year.\n\n“There was a lot of improvement and it was great to cap off the year with a Grand Final win in an unbelievable set of circumstances. I’m really proud.”\n\nTwelve months ago Boyd was playing VFL as the Western Bulldogs qualified for an unlikely finals appearance but now the 38-game veteran is a key part of coach Luke Beveridge’s team. \n\nROUND 1: PIES, BULLDOGS SET FOR BLOCKBUSTER\n\nGOOD FRIDAY: ROOS COULD HOST DOGS IN GAME ON HOLY DAY\n\nSUPERCOACH: TRADED STARS TO KEEP AN EYE ON\n\nHe has found his niche as a tall forward who can go into the ruck, with his mobility around the ground making him the perfect modern-day back-up.\n\nBoyd, 21, is working towards making that role more permanent, and will tailor his training over the pre-season to maintain strength and build on his endurance.\n\n“I was really big when I was up there (GWS), I did a lot of weights and I was strong but you still need to be able to cover the ground,” Boyd told the club’s website.\n\n“I’m somewhere in the middle — increasing my running power (is a focus) and finding a way to be strong enough and mobile enough to be able to play both ruck and forward is really important.”\n\nTravis Cloke will join Boyd in the Bulldogs forward line next season, with the former Magpies All-Australian keen to start working with the young star.\n\nThe opportunity to join forces with the former No.1 draft pick, who earned votes for the Norm Smith Medal, was one of the main reasons why Cloke chose the Bulldogs as his new home.\n\n“I’ve taken a bit of an interest in his football over the last few years, since he made the move to the Dogs, it’s been well publicised, the pressure that he’s under,” Cloke said. “He’s got so much potential and I’d love to help him out where I can.\n\n“Sitting back and seeing the way Boydy played in that Grand Final was fantastic.

England, it was 10.07am and Vincent Kompany, captain of City’s sister club Manchester City, was watching the Melbourne derby.\n\nAn excited Kompany retweeted a clip of Cahill’s goal before posting, “Congratulations @MelbourneCity with yesterday’s win. No better feeling than a derby win!” to his 2.66 million followers.\n\nIt was much earlier in New York, but former Melbourne City player David Villa, from another sister club, New York City, tweeted: “Congrats @MelbourneCity for a big win in the #MelbourneDerby #Cityfamily.”\n\nIn Shepparton this weekend, 1500 children are dreaming of replicating Cahill’s heroics at a massive annual junior tournament in AFL heartland.\n\nTeams were turned away and all 3000 beds were booked out two months ago, forcing some families to stay in scout halls over an hour away and even over the border in NSW.\n\nFootball Federation Australia has struggled to convert the record two million soccer participants into A-League fans, but Cahill’s arrival has turbocharged the competition.\n\nAnd the Socceroos superstar is aware of his all-encompassing role.\n\n“I will be in among everything. People say my name and double-take and ask for photos, but this is what I’ve embraced and I feel comfortable,” Cahill said.\n\n“I’ve taken heaps of photos with kids in Melbourne, around Southbank and it’s awesome. I want them to be able to have a connection with me and I don’t want to be this elusive guy. I want the kids to get what they see on TV.”\n\nMelbourne City’s owner, City Football Group, identified Cahill as the missing piece of its Melbourne jigsaw, likening him to former French international player Patrick Vieira, now cutting his coaching teeth at New York City.\n\nSydney FC rejected CFG’s approach in 2013, so the Abu Dhabi group switched the focus of its Asian plans to Melbourne City.\n\nCFG has invested more than $70 million in the club after buying it for $11.25 million in January 2014.\n\nCahill, who is a big name in China after stints at Shanghai Shenhua and Hangzhou Greentown, is a key part of the growth strategy, and City insiders say he made a huge impression on CFG chairman Khaldoon Al-Mubarak during a long meeting in Abu Dhabi six weeks ago.\n\nCahill is as comfortable moving in business circles as he is negotiating the penalty area, but his on-field exploits have opened the doors.\n\nHis ability to stand up on the big occasion is unparalleled and his derby goal rippled around Australia.\n\nTennis legend Lleyton Hewitt led the applause on Twitter: “We shouldn’t be surprised @Tim_Cahill You legend! #AgeIsNoBarrier.” And former cricket stars Adam Gilchrist (“Unbelievable @Tim_Cahill That’s why ... #MelbDerby”) and Brett Lee joined the chorus of approval.\n\nHigh-profile recruits are not uncommon in the A-League, with Harry Kewell (Melbourne Victory), Alessandro Del Piero and Dwight Yorke (Sydney FC) among them, but no club has been better placed than Melbourne City to capitalise on Cahill’s widespread appeal. Signing and managing superstars is its forte — with Villa, Frank Lampard and Andrea Pirlo in New York and Sergio Aguero, Kevin De Bruyne, and Carlos Tevez in Manchester.In Cahill, City and the A-League could not have a better statesman. Three days before the Melbourne derby, on the morning after the Socceroos’ 1-1 draw with Japan, Cahill did three hours of interviews, photoshoots and autograph signing — all with a smile on his face, when many others would have lost it.\n\nHis arrival at City has come at a time of renewed calls for boldness from the game’s stakeholders and leaders, led by Socceroos boss Ange Postecoglou, who was influential in bringing him to the A-League.\n\nExpansion is on the agenda. And a high-profile overseas club is understood to have shown interest in investing in the A-League.\n\nWith a new TV deal being negotiated, increased revenue streams and more blue-chip investment, the league is better placed than ever to attract stars.\n\nMedia outlets from the UK, France, Portugal, Spain, the US, Turkey and Sweden featured Cahill’s stunning derby goal, several years after Sydney FC’s signing of Italian star Del Piero won global exposure.\n\n“Tim is our headline act and he put out a No. 1 hit single last Saturday night,’’ FFA chief executive David Gallop said. “He’s not a one-hit wonder, either. He puts them out nearly every time he goes on to the big stage. That goal went around the world and that showcases the \nA-League, and to get it in a Melbourne derby was magical.\n\n“Domestically, it couldn’t have come at a better time as the season starts and the media rights negotiations are under way.’’\n\nWhile many of his Socceroos golden generation teammates have fallen by the wayside, Cahill has not only survived but flourished under Postecoglou and become Australia’s record goalscorer. At 36, the carrot of playing in the 2018 World Cup in Russia is dangling before him.\n\n“People watching now are waiting to see some sort of slip in standards or in his ability to do what he does, but he’s still there,” Postecoglou said.\n\n“He’s still a very important part of what we do and more importantly, as everyone continues to see, he’s still very motivated.”\n\nAfter a 3-2 loss to Perth Glory on Friday night, City hosts Adelaide United in the A-League on Friday nigh, but a bigger priority is beating Melbourne Victory on Tuesday in an FFA Cup semi-final, with CFG desperate for a piece of silverware.\n\nFox Sports commentator Andy Harper said the A-League had to leverage the Cahill effect.\n\n“Tim’s probably repaid the investment with that one goal because that sets the benchmark for the league and his contributions,” he said. “It’s only one piece of the puzzle, and one of my ongoing laments of the league is a lack of a co-ordinated marketing and publicity and lack of imagination in taking stars like Bruno Fornaroli and Thomas Broich to the marketplace.\n\n“We’ve relied on the Del Piero and Cahill factor and Timmy delivered big time. The challenge is to spread that load with a more concerted effort and make Fornaroli a big name in Melbourne and get people talking about Bruce Kamau.”\n\nCity may have made the big investment but the game — from Sydney to Shepparton and beyond — looks set to reap the rewards.\n\ndavid.davutovic@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"\n\n","kicker":"Tim’s thunderbolt","byline":"DAVID DAVUTOVIC","commentsAllowed":true,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":true,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["DAVID DAVUTOVIC"],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":[]},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":{"value":"aa899c13261a4905ed9f3e6ff7a8aca2","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/content/v2/aa899c13261a4905ed9f3e6ff7a8aca2"},"originId":"5cf077ba-981e-11e6-a368-50371b0b9b4a","origin":"METHODE","channel":"WEB","title":"The night Molly would rather forget","subtitle":"The night that almost saw Molly Meldrum leave Australia for good","description":"AT THE start of October 1995, Sony boss Denis Handlin called me in New York. \n\n","link":"http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/aa899c13261a4905ed9f3e6ff7a8aca2?domain=heraldsun.com.au","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","originalSource":"Sunday Herald Sun","creditedSource":"Herald Sun","subscriptionSummary":"IT was meant to be a night of celebration for one of the most influential men in Australia’s music history, but it almost saw Molly Meldrum leave Australia for good.","originalAssetId":"8c317eba-9653-11e6-b17b-cefc9a8ab3fc","version":"PUBLISHED","dateUpdated":"2016-10-22T23:55:42.000Z","dateLive":"2016-10-22T11:00:00.000Z","customDate":"2016-10-22T11:00:00.000Z","dateCreated":"2016-10-19T23:27:05.000Z","status":"ACTIVE","thumbnailImage":{"contentType":"IMAGE","id":{"value":"d908aa4a3d16c43ceb0704884a2d34d4","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d908aa4a3d16c43ceb0704884a2d34d4"},"originId":"ca82d41a-9820-11e6-a368-50371b0b9b4a","origin":"METHODE","title":"The night Molly would rather forget","subtitle":"ca82d41a-9820-11e6-a368-50371b0b9b4a","description":"The night Molly would rather forget","link":"http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/thumbnail/d908aa4a3d16c43ceb0704884a2d34d4","paidStatus":"NON_PREMIUM","originalSource":"Supplied","version":"PUBLISHED","dateUpdated":"2016-10-22T06:43:02.000Z","dateLive":"2016-10-22T11:00:00.000Z","dateCreated":"2016-10-22T06:28:48.000Z","status":"ACTIVE","related":[],"domainLinks":[],"categories":[],"keywords":["Picture Bruce","picture","home","Ian \"Molly\" Meldrum"],"authors":[],"domains":["heraldsun.com.au","cairnspost.com.au","ntnews.com.au","couriermail.com.au","themercury.com.au","adelaidenow.com.au","news.com.au","townsvillebulletin.com.au","perthnow.com.au","dailytelegraph.com.au","geelongadvertiser.com.au"],"locationGeoPoints":[],"urlTitle":"ca82d41a982011e6a36850371b0b9b4a","format":"jpeg","width":100,"height":75,"imageName":"Ian \"Molly\" Meldrum at his home.

he said, “we want you to come to Sydney for a party for Tina Arena. She’s doing a show, it’s also her birthday and we’re giving her an overseas award, which we’d like you to present to her.”\n\nDenis then told me it was a secret — Tina knew nothing about the award. The only problem was, at the time of the planned gig, Polygram Records had organised an overseas trip for me to interview some of their artists for Hey Hey It’s Saturday. When I explained this to Denis, the line went silent.\n\n“Right,” he said. “Leave it with me.”\n\nWhen I got home, there was a message from Polygram Records, saying my trip had been postponed. \n\nI called Denis and told him I was good to go to Tina’s party.\n\nI flew to Sydney and went to one of my favourite hotels. About 2pm, Steve Millard from Sony called to say he was coming to the hotel to keep me company and brief me on what was going to happen at the party. \n\n“Don’t worry about it,” I told Steve. “I’m just going to go to the hotel gym to work out.”\n\n“I’ll come over and work out with you,” Steve said, which was a little strange because Steve had never worked out in his life.\n\nShortly after Steve’s call, Mushroom’s Denise D’Sylva rang and said she was also coming over.\n\nSo, with Steve and Denise by my side, my afternoon was swallowed up. Steve explained the plan: Tina’s event was happening in the ballroom at the Sebel Townhouse. \n\nAfter a meet and greet with the retailers, she’d perform a song and I’d then walk out with the award. \n\n“No problems,” I said. “A piece of cake, let the show begin.”\n\nWe drove over to the Sebel and I was ushered into a private room and miked up by the crew. In the function room, I could hear Denis making a speech and then introducing Tina. She sang and sounded brilliant, as usual. Then I walked out, carrying her very heavy crystal award. I then started making a speech and went to give Tina her award. But instead of taking the trophy, she launched into a speech about me. She said how much she loved me and how much I’d done for the industry. It was very flattering, but very embarrassing, so I grabbed the microphone and said, “Cut the crap, Tina, this thing’s heavy … I’ll have to throw it at you.”\n\nTina stopped, then looked at the crew and said, “Oh s---, I’m going to have to do this again?”\n\nShe then proceeded to make the same speech about how great I was. I thought the poor girl had lost her marbles.\n\nThen, out of the corner of my eye, I saw Mike Munro creeping onto the stage. Aha, now it all made sense — they’re doing a This Is Your Life on Tina!\n\n“Yes, go ahead,” I said to Mike, as I stepped back and started to walk off stage.\n\nTina looked suitably surprised and confused. Then Mike stepped in front of me and uttered seven words that totally shook me: “Ian ‘Molly’ Meldrum, This Is Your Life.”\n\nI was so shocked, my legs literally gave way.\n\nI couldn’t believe it. \n\nAs I sat on the side of the stage, people were slapping me on the back, saying, “Congratulations! Congratulations!” But all I could think was, “What the f---’s going on? There’s no way they’re doing a This Is Your Life on me.” \n\nI kept saying, “No way, I’m not doing it!”\n\nMuch of it’s a blur now, but I remember someone saying, “Molly you have no option — the studio is full of all your friends and Channel Nine has spent a lot of money putting all this together.”\n\nI felt like I was drowning.\n\nI was driven to Channel Nine and given the VIP dressing room. But tonight it felt like a prison — I was trapped, and couldn’t get out to see what was going on.\n\nFinally, the floor manager summoned me and I was taken to the side of the studio.\n\nThe doors slid open and I was greeted by Mike Munro’s grinning face. I tried to muster at least half a smile as Mike patted me on the back.\n\nNow I was in the middle of a circus.\n\nI know this sounds strange coming from a guy who’s been on TV for 50 years, but I’m actually a very private person. I’ve always shielded my family and friends from public scrutiny. I meant it when I said to Mike, “Over my dead body!” And on the show that night, I was slowly dying.\n\nTo be fair to Mike and my friends, they didn’t know the timing was bad — I was dealing with a lot of dramas at the time. I was arguing with Jan, the mother of my adopted son Morgan, over a few issues. And I was fighting with Peter Andre, trying to convince him to spend more time in Australia and focus on his career here. \n\nMy friends thought the show was a wonderful tribute and a celebration of my life, and it was. I was being ungracious. But it was seriously the last thing I needed in my life at the time. I overreacted to just about everything — including Denise Drysdale claiming she was the first person to call me Molly. Of course, people have different memories, but \nI know for a fact that radio legend Stan “The Man” Rofe was responsible for my Molly name .\n\nYou know the drill on This Is Your Life — you hear a voice and then the screen slides back to reveal who it belongs to. Looking back, my friends and family actually had some funny things to say that night. \n\nI’d been trying for days to track down my mate and Mushroom boss Michael Gudinski. We needed to sort out our problems with Peter Andre, but I was told Michael was in London and couldn’t be contacted.\n\nThen the screen slid back — and there was Michael. As we embraced, I hissed, “Mmmm, we’re in London, are we?” But my surprises didn’t end there. The next guest said: “I first met Molly five years ago when I was on . Molly was a judge and after my performance, he turned around and offered me a [recording] contract live on air. So he gave me my initial break and is responsible for where I am now. We’ve had our good times and our arguments, but he’s certainly the kind of person that if he believes in you, he’ll support you all the way.”\n\nThey were kind words, but I was furious. I’d been trying for days to speak with Peter Andre, calling him all around the world with no success. Now here he was, smiling and surprising me on This Is Your Life.\n\nAfter the show, I also discovered there’d been some dramas backstage. Peter Andre apparently said something derogatory about Australia — that he didn’t care about the local market because he was breaking big in the UK. Deni Hines didn’t appreciate Peter’s attitude and she slapped him.\n\nThere was more drama in this one episode of This Is Your Life than an entire season of Neighbours.\n\nFortunately, Peter flew back to London that night, otherwise he would’ve copped a serve from me.\n\nJust when I thought the night couldn’t get any worse, the door opened to reveal the night’s final guest: my 10-year-old adopted son, Morgan.\n\nI was stunned and devastated. How could Morgan’s mum have allowed him to appear on national television?\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’ve always been so proud of Morgan. Morgan calls me Dad, and I’m proud to call him my son. But I have always protected him from the media. \n\nI’d been offered up to $60,000 to do “exclusive” stories with him, but declined every media request, except for a  story, which I did for free when Morgan was four, to make other magazines and reporters less interested in the story.\n\nWhen the taping finished, I was fuming. And I was looking for someone to blame.\n\n“Who the f--- organised this?”\n\nI then spotted my boyfriend, Rui, in the audience. We’d only just started going out, and he was beginning to think he’d walked into a scene from One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest — especially after the show, when he shared a taxi with me, Jan, Morgan and Denise Drysdale, and Jan and I had a horrible argument. Rui got out of the car and went straight to the airport, sleeping at the Ansett Lounge until the first flight back to Melbourne.\n\nDenis Handlin had left the taping of the show to go to Tina’s birthday dinner at the Sebel, which was also the location for my “after party”. \n\nOn the steps of the Sebel, Denis spotted Michael Gudinski, who warned him, “Denis, don’t go near Molly, all hell’s broken loose. It’s a disaster — the whole thing’s gone wrong. He hates all of us!”\n\nBut Denis, never one to take a backward step, went to find me. As soon as I saw him, I told him he’d ruined my life. \n\n I ran out of the hotel, declaring, “That’s it, I’m leaving Australia for good!”\n\nWorried about my wellbeing, Denis drove to all the local bars and clubs over the next few hours, trying to find me.\n\nAbout 7 the next morning I called Denis at home. “That’s it,” I told him, “I’m quitting the industry. I’m leaving Australia. You’ll never see me again.” \n\nI slammed the phone down. Denis called me back; I hung up again. Over the next 90 minutes or so, we exchanged about a dozen calls.\n\nDenis later told me it was “a ride through hell”.\n\nI also called my oldest friend, Sandy. She tried to explain that my friends had organised the show because they loved me.\n\n“Well, you’ve all had your 15 seconds of fame,” I spat, before I told her how much I hated her and that I was going to move to Bangkok.\n\n“Well, p--- off then,” she said. \n\nWhen I flew home to Melbourne I immediately booked a flight to Bangkok. I called  producer, Pam Barnes.\n\n“That’s it, I’m off.”\n\n“You can’t,” Pam replied. “You’re doing Hey Hey this week.”\n\n“F--- Hey Hey!”\n\nFortunately, Thailand has always been good for my health. After a week, I was again thinking straight, and felt ashamed about how I’d treated my friends. \n\nI might have overreacted.\n\nThe only thing I really objected to was Morgan’s appearance.\n\nFunnily enough, to this day, Morgan says appearing on This Is Your Life with me is one of his proudest moments.\n\nFor me, well, it’s a night I’d rather forget. But as they say, time heals all wounds. About 18 months after my ill-fated appearance, I called Sandy — who later described the whole episode as “an unfortunate series of incidents” — with some news.\n\n“Guess what I’ve got to do?  for Richard Tyler.”\n\nAh Well, Nobody’s Perfectby Molly Meldrum with Jeff Jenkins.

new book, Live a Beautiful Life, reveals she starts the day with a Healing Turmeric Juice, has an Alkalizing Green Smoothie if her skin is breaking out and goes to bed dreaming of Matcha Energy Balls.\n\nShe is also passionate about exercise and advocates readers follow a punishing workout routine that involves a 15km bike ride along with 80 bum lifts, 120 reverse lunges and 100 deep squats on the first day.\n\nOther beauty secrets of this former Miss Universe Australia include taking turmeric and black pepper tablets, drinking up to three litres of water a day and rubbing a mixture of vodka, bicarb soda and coconut oil on her skin.\n\nAlthough she cooks most meals from scratch, Ms Campbell does rely on supplements like spirulina, Udo’s oil, fish oil and magnesium.\n\nIn the book, which will be released next week, she writes that she loves to leave the gym “a hot sweaty mess”.\n\n“I push myself as hard as I can and leave nothing in the tank at the end,” she says.\n\nMs Campbell writes that she is “not ashamed to say” that she sees a mental health professional regularly.\n\n“I’ve found it really helpful and I feel so much better after a session, I got to download all my worries and stresses,” she says.\n\nShe also details the “plethora of pressures” she’s faced, which include living a life in the public eye after winning Miss Universe Australia, media scrutiny and her fiance Buddy Franklin’s battle with mental illness.\n\nMs Campbell also says she was an ugly duckling at high school and bullied by the popular girls.\n\n“As a teenager I was the girl with the longest school skirt, I wore glasses and had braces, was teased for being studious and called a teacher’s put on numerous occasions,” she writes.\n\nMs Campbell recounts a time at high school when one of the “popular pretty girls” excluded her when handing out invitations for her party.\n\n“I remember feeling so small that day. I cried when I got home from school. I knew I hadn’t been invited because I didn’t drink and wasn’t cool and would have been seen as a downer at the party. I was only fifteen,” she writes.\n\nThe book, published by Hachette, is dedicated to Mr Franklin, whom she calls her “best friend and soulmate”.\n\n“Thank you for not complaining once when the computer was set up in the lounge room for months on end as I typed away while you watched TV. I owe you one hundred cuddles for every time you went to bed and I stayed up working on this. X,” she writes.\n\n","standFirst":"JESINTA Campbell reveals in her new book she doesn’t diet, starts her day with a Healing Tumeric Juice and owes Buddy “one hundred cuddles” for allowing her to work on her book.\n\n","kicker":"Secret to happiness","byline":"SUSIE O’BRIEN","commentsAllowed":true,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":true,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["SUSIE O’BRIEN"],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":[]},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":{"value":"49f6d154aba6506b26322c69d23a3dd9","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/content/v2/49f6d154aba6506b26322c69d23a3dd9"},"originId":"85f952e2-958c-11e6-b17b-cefc9a8ab3fc","origin":"METHODE","channel":"NONE","title":"Carrie Bickmore: why I find Christmas difficult","subtitle":"Carrie Bickmore: why I find Christmas so difficult","description":"A few weeks ago, I saw fruit mince pies in the supermarket.

In fact, I had only happy Christmases. Some years we’d have a big lunch at our house; other years we’d visit family interstate. Fishing in Port Lincoln, going to midnight mass, giggling as Mum belted out O Come, All Ye Faithful, eating pav and custard till I’d burst. \n\nThere was always swimming. Oh, and randoms. Mum always invited people from church or the neighbourhood who had nowhere else to go. As kids it was equally as amusing as it was confusing that we had to pull a bonbon with people we didn’t really know. \n\nWhatever we did for the festive season, it was filled with lots of people and we created wonderful memories.\n\nSo why then did I always feel teary around Christmas? Lonely even. That sounds ridiculous, doesn’t it, given the experiences I just described? \n\nMaybe it was because our family was scattered across different states. My parents were divorced and lived on opposite sides of the country, so I could never be with both of them. Who knows what it was? \n\nAs an adult, I know exactly why I find Christmas hard. It’s the time of year I lost someone I loved dearly; it’s a time I am reminded of those wonderful humans who shaped my past but no longer sit at the table with us. I miss their cinnamon-smelling hugs, their bad jokes, their funny Christmas videos. Christmas is not the same without them. Every day is not the same without them, but at Christmas it feels amplified. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I still make Christmas fun for the kids. We spend weeks cooking bauble-shaped biscuits, making decorations; there are always presents under the tree and cousins to share their new toys with. But when I close my eyes feeling full and tipsy at the end of the day, the overwhelming feeling is one of relief. It’s over.\n\nWe are told how Christmas should make us feel, but for many that’s not the case. Life gets in the way. Death, financial stress, physical and mental illness, unresolved fights, the list is endless.\n\nSo as I walked through that supermarket feeling weird/sad/annoyed that Christmas had started in spring, I wondered: “What do we do… cancel Christmas?” \n\nI am not the Grinch. Can we ask supermarkets to at least wait till November? That’s not going to happen. Should we push advertisers to reflect the real Christmas, recognising the sadness, longing and loneliness some people must bear? Sadness doesn’t sell tinsel.\n\nMaybe my mum had it right when she invited strangers to Christmas. It was always less about presents, decorations and indulgence, and more about inclusion, reaching out and offering the best gift possible – the chance for people not to feel lonely. \n\nI should count myself lucky I have a family to share fruit mince pies with. But I’ll buy mine in December. \n\nCarrie co-hosts The Project, 6.30pm weeknights, on Network Ten.\n\n","standFirst":"WE ARE told how Christmas should make us feel, but for many that’s not the case, writes Carrie Bickmore.

ex-footballer, who played for several Victorian clubs in the 1990s and 2000s, was found in the garage of a Heidelberg West unit on Friday night, sitting naked in a dog’s bed, the court heard. \n\nVictoria Police prosecutor Sgt Brooke Shears said the woman returned home around 7.30pm and heard noises coming from the garage. \n\n“The accused was sitting naked in the dog’s bed, grunting incoherently,” Sgt Shears said.\n\nShe said the accused called the woman “a wh---” and threatened to slash her tyres.\n\nThe man, in his 40s, said the statement was false and that he was only naked because he’d gotten caught in the rain.\n\n“These aren’t even my clothes,” he said of the outfit he was wearing in court.\n\nMagistrate Ross Betts refused the application for bail and the man continued to swear under his breath as he was led out of the dock. \n\nHe was remanded to appear at the Heidelberg Magistrates’ Court on Friday.\n\nbridget.davies@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"A

Maureen DuBois was asleep in her bedroom when a silver ute ran off the road at 4.40am and smashed into her Beresford St house.\n\nMaureen’s son, Jon DuBois said it was a narrow escape for his mother who lives by herself and who was only meters away from impact. \n\n“She’s shaken obviously, but she’s OK,” he told the Herald Sun. \n\n“The entire lounge room is absolutely demolished; it’s a big pile of rubble.”\n\nPolice are searching for a man they believe was involved in the incident.\n\n“A car travelling east along the road has struck a parked vehicle then travelled over the nature strip, through two fences and into a house,” Victoria Police spokeswoman Natalie Webster said.\n\nMs DuBois was not injured in the incident but will stay with family tonight.\n\n","standFirst":"AN elderly

searched high and low to find the hidden gems across our great state.\n\nFrom secret swimming holes to a hip wall-to-wall wine bar, here’s some lesser-known gems this Victorian hub has to offer.\n\nHIDDEN GEMS OF MELBOURNE’S WEST\n\n65 Brooke St, Inglewood.agedbeef.com.au\n\nFans of Inglewood Aged Beef think nothing of a four-hour round trip from Melbourne to buy some of the best beef and lamb in Victoria. Inglewood is famous for links to the eucalyptus oil industry, but a humble corner butcher — selling aged beef and Rockwood lamb direct from the farmer — has people flocking.\n\n11 View St, Bendigo\n\nNot all vintage stores are created equal. And Julie’s is one of the state’s best. It’s like a long-forgotten suitcase of grandma’s best dresses, bursting with vintage goodness. The store is filled with quality pieces; from heavy, one-off fur jackets and intricately beaded 1920s flapper dresses, to real rabbit collars, devoré silk velvet wraps, polka-dot chiffon dresses and retro jewellery. \n\n9 Walker St, Castlemaine.millcastlemaine.com.au\n\nIt’s hard not to be transported to Vienna in the opulent surroundings of Das Kaffeehaus. The cafe is in a revitalised precinct near the old Castlemaine Woollen Mill that features a brewery, sourdough bakery and vintage and makers’ market. The cafe serves dishes such as goulash, sausage and boiled eggs with soldiers — and maybe the meanest coffee in regional Victoria.\n\nBridgewater\n\nThe Loddon River is the lifeblood of the town of Bridgewater. On the water, there is a dedicated ski area, as well as a slalom and ski jump area. But it’s the pretty swimming hole — with a grassy picnic area, deck and bathing platform, and barbecue — that’s one of Victoria’s best secret spots for a hot day. \n\nCnr Sailors Gully and Peg Leg roads, Eaglehawk. starcinema.org.au\n\nIf the thought of watching an arthouse film on the big screen — sitting on a comfy couch with a glass of wine — sounds appealing, add Star Cinema to the bucket list. The cinema, in the Eaglehawk Town Hall, is run by volunteers and uses the hall’s original projection room. \n\nBoort-Pyramid Rd, Boort\n\nIt plays second fiddle to better-known Lake Boort next door, but Little Lake Boort is just as pretty. The best way to see the lake is via a 3.7km trail, which takes about an hour. Nearby Lake Boort Reserve is Australia’s largest scarred tree site, with about 900 trees scarred by the Dja Dja Wurrung people. \n\nTerrick Terrick National Park, Mitiamo.parkweb.vic.gov.au\n\nApart from a few silos or majestic gums, the landscape at Mitiamo, between Bendigo and Echuca, is pretty unremarkable — until Mitiamo Rock comes into view. The 187m granite outcrop rises above the plains, offering panoramic views of farmland and bush. The rock is a great nature-based day out. \n\n50 Station St, Clarkefield\n\nLocated on a dead-end street off the Melbourne-Lancefield Rd, the Coach and Horses Inn is becoming known as one of Victoria’s most haunted hotels. Legend has it a Chinese man who was hung and an Irishman shot out the front visit the two-storey bluestone hotel. \n\n","standFirst":"THINK you know the best the Loddon Mallee south region has to offer?

Credlin on Malcolm Turnbull","userOriginUpdated":"yaminee","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"HeraldSun","urlTitle":"Peta-Credlin-Malcolm-Turnbulls-delivery-begins-at-last","revision":5,"body":"On the plus side of the ledger, the Government passed legislation protecting volunteer firefighters from union control, and giving tax cuts to middle-income earners.\n\nThese are sensible changes which fulfil commitments the Coalition made at the last election. These wins should be cause for quiet confidence among all of us that this term might actually be, as the Prime Minister has pledged, one of “delivery”.\n\nUnfortunately, by week’s end “own goals” from the Government overshadowed their legislative achievements and yet again put the spring in Labor’s tactical step.\n\nCOALITION EMBARRASSED AFTER CRITICISING ITSELF IN OPPOSITION MOTION\n\nANDREW BOLT: MALCOLM TURNBULL TRAPPED IN NO-MAN’S LAND\n\nFinancial Services Minister Kelly O’Dwyer has been in the parliament for eight years and is a Cabinet minister. She’s no rookie but she keeps making rookie mistakes. This surprises me as she’s a former senior staffer and she’s smart. But letting Labor embarrass you by passing a second reading amendment isn’t smart. And not being ready for one is dumb because second reading amendments are the stock in trade of Oppositions. After all, we used them often.\n\nMinister O’Dwyer claimed it was just a “procedural mistake” and Leader of the House Christopher Pyne called it a mere “inadvertent error”. Seriously. It is not a sackable offence despite Labor’s overreach but as we’re told this is the first time its happened in more than 100 years, it’s not “nothing” either. \n\nAdded to the lost votes in the first sitting week and the failure to have any real business for the Senate to get on with in the second week, it reinforced the impression of a Government that’s not quite on top of things.\n\nWith Christmas comes the reshuffle season and everyone in Canberra knows that Malcolm Turnbull has a short fuse and doesn’t suffer fools. With the House back next week and only a handful of sitting weeks left this year, both O’Dwyer and Pyne need to lift their game in the chamber. Calling them stunts is all well and good but when the news bulletins run the chaos story before any hard-won achievements, then the Government’s got a problem that must be fixed.\n\nBut this wasn’t the only error.\n\nBy giving four federal seats to the Coalition, the Victorian Labor Government’s attempt to bully volunteer fire fighters helped save Malcolm Turnbull’s prime ministership. The Coalition’s legislation stopping industrial agreements from restricting the work of volunteers is common sense. As well as the actual policy substance, being able to get something through the difficult Senate is a real achievement and protecting the 60,000 Victorian Country Fire Authority volunteers from operational emasculation was a great win for the Coalition.\n\nBut Channel 7’s report on this good news focused not on the win but on another stuff-up: there was an ACT fire truck at the Government’s media event for which no official permission had been obtained. \n\nPerhaps the PM’s staffers anticipated a refusal from ACT authorities and decided to risk it and go ahead anyway. Savvy operators would have held the event just 10 minutes across the border in Queanbeyan where a fire truck could have turned up with the blessing of the NSW Coalition Government. It was another unforced error for a Government that can’t afford to have its good news dropped out of the bulletin by elementary mistakes.\n\nStill, there are signs that the Turnbull team is finding its line and length. Julie Bishop had a standout week in Question Time and put Bill Shorten under real pressure.\n\nAgain there are calls for her to help out domestically not just overseas. The PM is becoming more assured in parliament and on a good day, the waffle is subdued. More importantly, he’s been focusing on something that matters to everyday people, namely keeping the power on and prices low.\n\nWhen the lights went out across South Australia, Turnbull ignored his previous enthusiasm for renewable energy at any price and instead attacked the state government, and Labor more generally, for putting their green obsession ahead of jobs and cost of living. \n\nSouth Australia now gets 40 per cent of its power from renewable energy. That’s on a good day. On a bad day — when the wind doesn’t blow or blows too hard — it relies on energy imported from the brown coal power stations of Victoria.\n\nAnd that’s the problem with renewables — you’ve got to have a backup for when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine. There has to be enough non-renewable baseload capacity in the system to kick-in on the days when renewable energy isn’t there. \n\nNo power company can rely on renewable energy alone or even mainly. Labor knows that cost of living matters to voters. That’s why every Question Time last week started with claims that the Government is cutting Medicare. It reinforces the dishonest scare campaign that was so effective during the election and their questions get under the Prime Minister’s skin. \n\nBut Labor is fooling itself if it thinks that it can promise 50 per cent renewable energy and a 45 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 without consumers noticing. Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said this week that it would cost nearly $50 billion to build enough windmills. Coupled with much more ambitious emissions targets, this means a carbon tax.\n\nSooner or later, Labor’s effective populism is going to collide with its actual policies. You can’t further boost renewable energy without skyrocketing power prices. You can’t increase taxes, even on so-called wealthy investors, without making ordinary people pay. Sooner or later, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten will have to confront the unions and the green-left activists within his own party and tell them that they can’t have everything they want. Or he’ll stay in opposition.\n\nRight now Bill Shorten’s not under any policy pressure but if the Government was on its strategic game, this is where they should take the fight. That, and smartening up their collective act so that dumb mistakes are a thing of the past.\n\nTHUMBS UP\n\nNSW Premier Mike Baird did the right thing reversing his greyhound racing ban. We can’t demand our political leaders listen to us and then criticise them when they do.\n\nTHUMBS DOWN\n\nThe race for the US presidency should be a contest of the best and brightest. It isn’t. Neither candidate is outstanding but Donald Trump’s repeated offensive slurs against women show how unworthy he is. It’s over, Donald.\n\n","standFirst":"IT HASN’T been all plain sailing for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull but good signs are starting to emerge, writes Peta Credlin.\n\n","kicker":"Positive

officer Peter Rau, deputy chief officer David Youssef, people and culture executive director Danielle Byrnes and property and assets executive director Craig Lloyd have all resigned.\n\nAssistant chief fire officers Darren Davies and Andrew Zammit are also on indefinite leave amid a growing exodus linked to ongoing tensions with the United Firefighters Union.\n\nEmergency Management Commissioner Craig Lapsley admitted he was concerned at the string of departures after the CFA lost its board, chief executive and chief fire officer over the bitter industrial dispute.\n\n“It’s a concern ... because I’ve got a changing team, so I’ve got to work harder at ensuring that the teams we operate in ... achieve great results,” Mr Lapsley said.\n\nHe said he was conscious of the need to strengthen co-operation with the CFA and MFB’s new leaders, adding there had been “a lot of noise” about instability but there was depth in the ranks.\n\n“When the call to action is there, in the preparedness or the response, they’ll be there and they’ll do it extremely well,” Mr Lapsley said.\n\nHe said recent “bumper rainfalls” had led to significant growth in fuel loads, paving the way for “critical fire days” once dry conditions set in.\n\nMr Lapsley said grass fires loomed as the biggest danger this summer and urged people to cut the fuel around their homes and properties.\n\nOpposition Leader Matthew Guy said the departure of MFB bosses — who he said were on a UFU “hit list” — meant the fire services were missing 300 years of collective senior experience.\n\n“On the eve of fire season, Victoria is haemorrhaging emergency services professionals because of Daniel Andrews’ pigheadedness,” Mr Guy said. “Victorians will be right to question whether they are more or less safe on the eve of fire season.”\n\nThe government said: “Victoria’s fire fighters are among the best in the world and are well prepared for the coming fire season.”\n\nIt comes as the MFB begins its search for a new chief officer after Peter Rau quit and filed a WorkSafe complaint about alleged bullying by the UFU.\n\nThe decision will be politically difficult, given acting chief fire officer Paul Stacchino raised the ire of government MPs last month when he slammed the brigade’s current workplace agreement with the UFU, saying parts of it were unworkable.\n\nHe told a parliamentary inquiry the union’s new log of claims would give them “an effective veto” and limit his powers.\n\nThe government said recruitment decisions were a matter for the MFB.\n\ntom.minear@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"THE Metropolitan Fire Brigade has lost 70 years of experience in a month as half its senior leadership team quit on the eve of the fire

we crossed the road and walked past the SCG, we peeked through to the Sheffield Shield game, which had started. South Australia were batting, and ­Hughesy was opening. If there’s going to be one silver lining to all of this, it might be that Hughesy gets my Test place.\n\nAs we look through the gate, I see that he is into the twenties. Perfect! I’ll go home for a shower and change, then come back to watch him bat. I know he’s in for a big one. He loves punishing his old Blues teammates. He’ll make a hundred and the selectors will have to pick him. \n\nWhen I get out of the shower, there are five missed calls on my phone. Strange. A couple are from Malcolm Conn, at Cricket NSW. \n\nMalcolm and I go a long way back. When he was chief cricket writer for The Australian and then The Daily Telegraph, we would be blueing one minute about something he’d written, and the next minute we would be collaborating, with him ghostwriting my columns for the paper. It typifies the up-and-down relationship I’ve had with the media through my career. \n\nMalcolm has now moved from journalism to our side of the fence, as a communications officer for Cricket NSW and Cricket Australia. \n\nI’m moving around my bedroom getting my things ready to go. “What’s going on?” I ask Mal.\n\nHis voice is flat. “Have you heard about Hughesy?” \n\n“What?” I laugh. “Has he got a hundred already?”\n\n“He’s been hit on the head and a helicopter’s about to land on the SCG.”\n\nI stop moving. I’m almost too shocked to speak. “Is he all right?”\n\n“We don’t know.”\n\nEverything else empties out of me. All the arguments that have been spinning around my head for days and weeks, everything that has been driving me crazy and putting the cricket world into a lather — it’s all gone. There’s nothing in me except one thought: Hughesy.\n\nI must run every red light between home and the inner city. I’m going like a race car driver. \n\nIn the car, I speak to Dave Thompson, the Cricket NSW operations manager.\n\n“He’s not at the SCG,” he says.\n\n “Where’s he been taken?” \n\n“He’s been put in an ambulance and is going to St Vincent’s ­Hospital.”\n\nI whiz to St Vincent’s, which is only a few minutes from the SCG. Out of my mind, I park in the ambulance area and run into emergency. Tim Nielsen, my old Cricket Australia coach who’s now South Australia’s head of high performance, and some other SA Cricket people are there.\n\n“Where is he?” I say to Tim.\n\nBefore he can reply, a member of the hospital staff grabs me. “He’s been taken for a CT scan. Come through, his family’s in here.”\n\nAs I’m being taken to the room where they are waiting, Hughesy is being wheeled past on a trolley. He looks normal. There’s still a sheen of sweat on his face, and his hand, when I hold it, is hot. He has a scratch on his face from where he fell forward onto the pitch. I notice a little bit of facial swelling, but not much. My first thought is, he’ll be right.\n\nHughesy’s mum Virginia, his brother Jason and his sister Megan are all in tears. When I come into the room, they get up and we’re just ­hugging and crying for a long time. Virginia’s asking me a lot of questions about what happens next. I don’t have a clue. All I can say is “he’s in the best hands”. \n\nThey begin explaining the shot Hughesy was playing when he was hit. NSW were bowling short to stop Hughesy scoring. He went to hook a bouncer but got through his shot too early. The ball hit him in the back of his head or the top of his neck, just beneath the rim of his helmet. He was 63 not out.\n\nAt this stage, we’re unaware of what is going on in the outside world. Everything has shrunk down to this hospital ward. We don’t know that they have called off the game entirely, as none of the players could bring themselves to go back on the field. \n\nNor do we know that the full round of Sheffield Shield matches around the country, and the Indians’ game in Adelaide, will be abandoned. It’s not the time for cricket. Nor will it be for a long while.\n\nWhen Hughesy is taken up to the next floor for more scans, we follow and are put in another waiting room. It’s all a blur. Virginia’s barely able to speak, she’s crying so much. Greg, Hughesy’s dad, is up at his farm near Macksville on the north coast. \n\nSomeone has rung to organise him a flight down, but there are no seats out of Coffs Harbour, so the plans have been changed and he’s driving to Port Macquarie to fly from there. \n\nA surgeon comes to us, sits us down, and says, “We’ve had the scan results. There’s been a bleed and we’ve got to release the swelling as quickly as possible.” In order to do so, they have to ­operate.\n\nTime dissolves. I don’t know how long has passed. After the surgery, the doctor comes out and tells us the ­operation hasn’t been able to slow the swelling. ­Hughesy’s family are suffering ­intensely, and the doctor isn’t sure that they’re able to take in what he’s telling them.\n\n“Michael,” he says, “Can we have a word privately?”\n\nHe wants to take me aside and spell it out, so that I can pass it on to them. He thinks there’s a better chance that they will be able to focus on what I’m saying. The swelling’s going up, he explains.\n\nI keep asking, “Can you give me more information?” \n\nI am feeling kind of clear on the outside, but empty within, like what he’s saying is just echoing around inside me. I need to hear it more than once before I can comprehend it.\n\nThe doctor tells me that there is a lot of swelling in Hughesy’s brain, and they need to release it. They will operate again and then place him in an induced coma.\n\nAfter a few more hours of waiting, we jump to our feet as the doctor reappears. He says the news is better. “The swelling has slowed down, which is a good sign. We’re going to keep him in the coma overnight and see how much more it comes down. We’ll keep our fingers crossed, but won’t know much until the morning.”\n\nBy now it is eight or nine in the evening, about six hours since ­Hughesy was hit. Inside the waiting room, Greg has arrived and the family go through periods of quiet. Outside, the corridors are silent. I pace up and down the corridor outside ­Hughesy’s room for hours. ­\n\nAt about 3.30am, I find my car and drive home. I’m only thinking, Will he be right to play cricket again? That’s all. I’m still focused on cricket, nothing bigger than that. \n\nI lie on my bed, and my mind is still squirrel-wheeling around in this little circle. Will he be OK for the Test match? If not, will he be right for the Second Test? I’m not reflecting on Hughesy and our friendship. That would be like allowing too much in. I can only focus on what the doctors will tell us tomorrow.\n\nTrying to sleep is pointless. At 5.30am, I’m back in the car. At St ­Vincent’s, ­Hughesy’s family are where I left them, going through lulls in between bouts of crying.\n\nIt’s midmorning when a doctor comes in and tells us there has been a change since the optimistic news last night. They can’t control the swelling and have increased his medication. \n\nWe don’t know what to do or say. But every piece of news that doesn’t say, he’ll be OK, he’ll be playing again soon, is shattering. After staying with the family for a while, I go back in and see him. Last night, his face was swelling up but he was still recognisable, still Hughesy. Now, in the morning, he’s much more puffed up.\n\nThis is the first time I look back at him and see that it isn’t him. He is still breathing, through the tube feeding oxygen into his mouth, but it isn’t him. He doesn’t have that typical warm Hughesy sweat across his forehead and cheeks, like he had yesterday. The beat of his heart and the flow of oxygen — it’s like the machine is doing it, keeping him alive, more than his own body is.\n\nI stay in the room with him for a fair while. Hours. I just hold his hand and urge him to come back to us. Am I saying goodbye? No. I’m fogged up by shock, just saying the same encouraging words over and over again. If I move off from that topic, I talk about cricket: how he’s going to play in the Test match, how I’ve lost my battle with CA, but we’re going to get justice because Hughesy’s going to go out there as my replacement and score a hundred. No, a double hundred.\n\nLater, we will be told that on impact, in that split second when the ball hit him, he was effectively gone. I won’t be able to accept that. That’s too tough for me to take. \n\nRight through that first afternoon and evening in hospital, for all the hours I’ve been talking to him, I’ve never let anything like this filter into my head. It’s only cricket. He might be out of the game for a few weeks. But he can’t die.\n\nI know what my friendship with Phillip Hughes was. Over the days following his passing, my role as Australian captain overlapped with my personal grief at losing one of my best mates. It was hard to separate the two. \n\nManaging the scene in the hospital, bringing players together, giving a eulogy at his funeral, and then, after long negotiations, taking the field in a Test match two weeks later — I had no chance to retreat into my private space and grieve for the bloke I regard as my little brother.\n\nMy Story — Michael Clarke, published by Macmillan Australia, is out on Tuesday.

Brown Collingwood trade: St Kilda","userOriginUpdated":"twomeyl1","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Collingwood-defender-Nathan-Brown-has-joined-St-Kilda-as-a-free-agent","revision":9,"body":"Brown has agreed to join St Kilda as a free agent, with the Magpies confirming they would not match the Saints’ offer. \n\nBrown played 130 matches across nine seasons in the black and white.\n\nSt Kilda chief operating officer Ameet Bains said the experienced defender is a welcome addition to the Saints.\n\n“Nathan is a handy acquisition for the club and will obviously strengthen our defence,” Bains said.\n\n“Bringing Nathan in as a free agent also allows us to fill a key need without compromising our overall trade position; an important consideration given the trades we have completed during this exchange period.\n\n“His ability to hold down a key defensive post makes him an attractive prospect for where our list is currently placed.\n\n“In addition to his experience and leadership on the field, Nathan is a terrific person off the field and we look forward to him joining our ranks.”\n\nBrown’s departure is another blow for the Pies who have now lost three key position defenders this off-season. \n\nJack Frost requested a trade to Brisbane after the Lions offered him a three-year contract. The Pies and Lions are expected to agree on a deal this week. \n\nPromising youngster Jonathon Marsh informed the Pies last week he wanted to return home to Perth for personal reasons. \n\nSmall defender Marley Williams is currently without a contract. \n\nMatthew Scharenberg and Tom Langdon are recovering from long term injuries while Alan Toovey has retired.\n\nThat leaves Collingwood to rely on Ben Reid, who has played 26 matches across the past three seasons, and Lachie Keeffe who is returning from a one-year suspension. \n\nThe Pies were initially hoping Keeffe would partner Darcy Moore in the Collingwood forward line but that may need a rethink. \n\nThe Magpies have been busy this trade period, with Daniel Wells and Chris Mayne joining the club. \n\nTravis Cloke will be traded to the Western Bulldogs this week. \n\n","standFirst":"COLLINGWOOD defender Nathan Brown has played his last game for the Magpies.

truck veered off the Coronado Bay Bridge in San Diego on Saturday afternoon (Sunday AEST) and landed in Chicano Park where a biker rally was being held, Fox San Diego reported.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol (CHP) Officer Jake Sanchez said the person behind the wheel of the pick-up truck, suspected of driving under the influence, hit a guard rail, rolled and landed on the crowd of people, NBC San Diego reported.\n\n“It’s horrible, it’s horrific,” said Sanchez, describing the scene. “There’s people down below, bodies — just innocent people that are just down here having a good time and now they’re gone. We feel for their families.”\n\nWitnesses said the truck landed on a vendor tent set up for La Raza Run, a motorcycle ride that ends with a celebration at the park and typically draws hundreds of participants. the crash happened in front of a stage where a rockabilly band was playing.\n\n“I saw a truck come right off the freeway. It was going so fast it flow over the stage and landed in front of the stage on a tent, a booth that was set up,\" Chase Dameron told San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\nHe said four people in the booth were crushed by the pickup.\n\n“It was like a movie. It was like in slow motion,” Dameron said. “Where it hit, there was dust and debris and instant chaos and panic. People running crazy.”\n\nDameron’s friend, George Rodriguez, said, “It’s something I won’t forget as long as I live.”\n\nA witness told NBC San Diego that he heard truck’s tyres screeching as it ploughed into the park below.\n\n“I [saw] that truck come flying off the ramp here and onto the people that were underneath hem. I was that close to them,” he said. “It’s terrible.”\n\nAnother witness said she saw parts of the car being scattered everywhere.\n\n“Pieces of car parts were flying all over the place. When we got up, we turned around, everybody started running over there because we realised, there were people sitting there — there were people sitting right there,” the woman told NBC San Diego.\n\n“We were trying to get in to see if we could maybe lift up the car, move the car out of the way to see if we could get the people out. There were so many people crowded by then.\n\nSan Diego Fire-Rescue Department spokesman Lee Swanson said the truck driver suffered major trauma and is now being treated for his injuries. Along with the driver, another person was also seriously hurt, while five others suffered minor injuries, Swanson said.\n\nThe injured victims were taken to either UC-San Diego or Scripps Mercy hospitals for treatment.\n\n","standFirst":"A PICKUP truck plunged 18 metres off a bridge in California, and landed on a crowd gathered at a park below, leaving at least four people

the Southeast Asian nation facing an uncertain future with the death of its revered monarch on Thursday, a new photo has emerged of the throne’s heir apparent looking more court jester than king.\n\nCrown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, 64, showed up at an airport in Munich recently, strutting around in a rolled-up tank top, sagging jeans and fake tattoos with a poodle in tow.\n\nIn contrast to his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whose death ends a 70-year reign, the playboy prince has a reputation among his soon-to-be subjects for bizarre behaviour, womanising and cruelty to his many wives, The New York Post reports.\n\nTaking a page from Caligula, Vajiralongkorn named his favourite pet, a poodle named Foo Foo, as an air marshal.\n\nHe even took the pooch to a 2007 reception hosted in his honour by US Ambassador Ralph “Skip” Boyce.\n\n“Foo Foo was ... dressed in formal evening attire complete with paw mitts, and at one point during the band’s second number, he jumped up onto the head table and began lapping from the guests’ waterglasses,” Mr Boyce wrote, according to a WikiLeaks document.\n\n“The Air Chief Marshal’s antics ... remains the talk of the town to this day.”\n\nBut tales of the prince’s behaviour exist mostly in the realm of rumour in Thailand. The nation has strict laws banning stories about the royal family.\n\nBut in 2007, the depravity of Vajiralongkorn’s court was exposed when a video surfaced of his third wife, Princess Srirasmi, a former bar waitress, walking around topless at her own birthday party while eating cake with Foo Foo.\n\nWhen the dog died last year, it was given a four-day funeral.\n\nSrirasmi has split from the prince after being booted from the Royal Palace in December. In a show of his cruelty, he recently allowed her parents to be thrown in prison for two and a half years for “royal defamation.”\n\nHis earlier two marriages were equally rocky. During his first — to his cousin — he allegedly fathered five kids with a mistress, then married the mistress. Later he dumped her, forcing her to flee the country.\n\nThe new images of him are sensitive, with officials detaining the Thai wife of a British journalist who put them online.\n\nWhile Vajiralongkorn is the heir apparent, some hope his younger sister, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, might ascend to the throne. But women are banned from the throne.\n\nVajiralongkorn, meanwhile. has asked for four days to mourn before being installed as king — but some observers think he only wants more time to party.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Post\n\n","standFirst":"HERE’S Thailand’s new king.

State Emergency Service registered 65 calls for help between midnight and 9.30am as winds hit areas southeast of Melbourne.\n\nSpokeswoman Karen Enbom said at 9am about 7200 homes across Victoria were without power.\n\n“The calls we had were primarily to do with trees and powerlines down,” Ms Enbom said.\n\n“It concentrated on the areas of Box Hill, Templestowe, Doncaster and Blackburn and then heading out east towards Chum Creek and Toolangi.\n\n“The biggest thing for us was that at one staged we had 7200 homes without power in those areas.\n\n“That has been revised down now as the power companies are getting on top of those issues.\n\n“It is slowly coming down.”\n\nMs Enbom said the latest figures she had seen showed more than 6000 customers remained without power.\n\nAusNet, which covers areas around the Dandenongs and Melbourne’s outer east, had 600 customers without power about 11.30am.\n\nThat had been reduced from about 1100 at 8am as the company works to restore electricity.\n\nFour men have been taken to hospital after strong winds caused their 3.5m boat to overturn in Westernport Bay off Jam Jerrup about 3.15am.\n\nA Victoria Police statement said the men had to “cling onto the vessel” in the rough conditions.\n\nOne of the men managed to save his mobile phone and call 000 for help.\n\n“The men were rescued by Hastings Volunteer Marine Rescue personnel and treated for hypothermia by emergency services on scene,” Victoria Police said.\n\n“The boat is still yet to be retrieved. \n\n“This is a timely reminder to members of the community to be aware of changing conditions and take caution when heading out into the water.”\n\nThe strongest winds were recorded last night at Melbourne Airport with 93km/h gusts at 12.15am.\n\nFawkner Beacon in Port Phillip Bay registered 87km/h winds at 1.38am, while Essendon Airport had gusts of 85km/h at 12.49am.\n\nBut Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Richard Carlyon said the wind has “settled down”.\n\n“They have gone past us now,” he said.\n\n“In the early hours of the morning we had the strongest peak in the winds and they have eased since dawn.\n\n“There are still fresh and gusty northerly winds ahead of a cold front this afternoon about 4pm, which will bring some rain.\n\n“We don’t expect the winds to be as strong as last night.”\n\nMelbourne registered “quite a warm night” with temperatures at 18C at 8.52am.\n\nMr Carlyon said the winds experienced last night were not as strong as those seen last Sunday.\n\nJohanne Peeke was killed when a tree fell on her Millgrove home and thousands of Victorians were left without power for a series of days.\n\n“Last weekend was a stronger front and we saw sustained winds above 100km/h in the Melbourne area for quite a few hours,” Mr Carlyon said.\n\n“(Last night) was what we call a low-end event for a weather warning.”\n\nThe bureau this morning issued a weather warning for damaging winds for much of Gippsland, but Mr Carlyon said the danger was mostly concentrated in Alpine regions.\n\nMt Hotham had 130km/h winds at 9.30am, while Mt Buller had 120km/h gusts at 8.48am\n\nmonique.hore@news.com.au\n\n@moniquehore\n\n","standFirst":"WILD winds have again lashed Victoria bringing down trees and cutting power to thousands of homes and

trade rumours: Biggest deals that didn’t happen Lance Franklin, Jonathan Brown, Tony Lockett","userOriginUpdated":"twomeyl1","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Biggest-AFL-blockbuster-trades-that-didnt-happen","revision":2,"body":"If you’re banking on Jaeger O’Meara becoming a Hawk, don’t be so sure. It wouldn’t be the first time a trade that seemed to be signed, sealed and delivered fell over before the trade deadline.\n\nTRADE WRAP: WHERE IS YOUR CLUB AT?\n\nLATEST: DEMONS OFFER LEWIS THREE-YEAR DEAL\n\nFrom Buddy to GWS, Plugger to Richmond and nearly everyone to Collingwood, here are some of our favourite blockbuster trades that weren’t.\n\nLANCE FRANKLIN TO GWS\n\nIt was almost common knowledge that Lance Franklin would leave Hawthorn and become a Giant at the end of 2013. Certainly, GWS and the AFL believed it. But Buddy — and his manager — pulled one of the great trade heists by joining Sydney instead. A nine-year contract worth $10 million may have had something to do with it.\n\nTONY LOCKETT TO RICHMOND\n\nAt the end of 1994 the rumour mill was on overdrive that superstar goalkicker Tony Lockett \n\nwas set to leave St Kilda. Richmond and Collingwood were the reported frontrunners with Lockett choosing the Tigers — Lockett’s management said he’d agreed to a three-year deal and the back page newspaper heading the next day was “Lockett a Tiger”. The only problem was Richmond couldn’t do a deal with the Saints and Plugger went north instead, becoming a Swan in three-way deal with Hawthorn.\n\nCHRIS JUDD TO MELBOURNE/COLLINGWOOD/ESSENDON\n\nThe premiership captain, Norm Smith and Brownlow medallist created one of the biggest trade \n\nfrenzies in history when he announced he wanted to return to Victoria two days after the Eagles bowed out of the 2007 finals. He few to Melbourne and met with Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon and Melbourne, with the Pies the early frontrunner. Judd chose the Blues — although that wasn’t confirmed until after Richmond tried to cut their lunch by offering the Eagles a better deal. Eventually West Coast settled for Josh Kennedy and picks 3 and 20 from the Blues. “They have got a young and exciting list,” Judd said. “I could be part of something from the ground up, that was the exciting part of it for me.”\n\nCHRIS GRANT TO PORT ADELAIDE\n\nWhen Port Adelaide joined the competition at the end of 1996 they made a huge $1.5 million offer to the Bulldogs champ. The Dogs didn’t have anywhere near that kind of cash but they did have an extra 20 cents courtesy of seven-year-old fan Ryan Adams, who attached the coin to a letter he sent to Grant pleading for him to stay. He did and while Grant retired without a flag, he was a board member for this year’s drought-breaking triumph — with Adams watching in the stands.\n\nJOE MISITI TO COLLINGWOOD\n\nThe end of 2001 was a painful time at Essendon, with the club crushed by salary cap pressure and several favourite sons seemingly on the way out. But despite contract talks breaking down a mooted Misiti to Magpies trade never happened. Teammates Damien Hardwick (traded to Port Adelaide) and Gary Moorcroft (Melbourne) didn’t survive the cull, with Blake Caracella (Brisbane), Chris Heffernan (Melbourne) and Justin Blumfield (Richmond) departing the next year.\n\nJADE RAWLINGS TO NORTH MELBOURNE\n\nIt’s now accepted wisdom that if a player declares he wants to join a certain club, he’ll get there in the end, but that wasn’t always the case. Jade Rawlings had his heart set on becoming a Kangaroo at the end of 2003 after he quit Hawthorn, sparking a five-club bidding war that also included Geelong, Melbourne, the Western Bulldogs and Port Adelaide. He met North Melbourne coach Dean Laidley and was walking into AFL House to sign the paperwork when his manager phoned to say the deal had fallen over. \n\nRawlings was the casualty of the infamous “Veale deal”, a three-way trade that sent Mark Alvey from the Bulldogs to Essendon, Danny Jacobs from the Bombers to Hawthorn and the unknown Veale from the Hawks to the Kennel. Rawlings was sent to the pre-season draft, where he was picked up by the Dogs. After two unsuccessful years at the kennel he got his wish to play alongside brother Brady at Arden St, but retired after just three games in blue and white.\n\nMARK ALVEY TO ESSENDON\n\nAlvey was the victim of possibly the most bizarre trade fail of all time 12 months earlier. He was meant to join the Bombers at the end of 2002 as part of a three-club deal for Blumfield, but Richmond only got involved in talks 20 minutes before the trade deadline and when the paperwork was finally ready at 1.58pm, the fax machine at AFL House was engaged. The Blumfield deal went through with 30 seconds left, but the Alvey paperwork missed the deadline. “It was madness,” then-Tigers footy boss Greg Miller said.\n\nJONATHAN BROWN TO COLLINGWOOD\n\nThe Magpies have been linked to nearly every big name in this year’s trade period and that continues a historical pattern. Collingwood did have a serious crack at getting Brown out of Brisbane — twice. In 2005 he was offered a $6 million four-year deal and in 2008 he had a secret meeting with coach Mick Malthouse. “I’d started talking to Collingwood 12 months earlier. About the middle of the year, about Round 13 or Round 14, I met with Mick Malthouse the day before we played a game,” Brown told Fox Footy’s Open Mike program. “I was really impressed and I thought at that stage, ‘I’m going to play for Collingwood’.” \n\nRYAN O’KEEFE TO HAWTHORN\n\nAt the end of 2008 Swans star O’Keefe decided he wanted to return to Victoria and met Hawthorn chiefs including coach Alastair Clarkson. O’Keefe knocked back a three-year contract from Sydney and declared his intentions, but the deal was scuttled when none of Hawthorn, Collingwood or Carlton was prepared to give up their first-round draft pick. History records O’Keefe opted against putting himself in the pre-season draft, returned to the Swans and became one of the club’s modern champions, winning the Norm Smith Medal in the 2012 flag. \n\nKURT TIPPETT TO BRISBANE/GOLD COAST\n\nIn a precursor to the Buddy shock, the Swans surprised the footy world when they snared Tippett at the end of 2012 after popular wisdom had the Crows big man returning to his home state of Queensland. Tippett rejected a five-year deal from the Crows and similar offers from Brisbane and Gold Coast, saying choosing Sydney was “a combined football/lifestyle decision”. Tippett was traded for Jesse White and pick 22, which seemed unders — a sentiment confirmed when it emerged the Crows had agreed to trade Tippett to the club of his choice for a second-round draft pick when he signed his last Crows contract in 2009. That move — plus payments outside the salary cap — cost Tippett and the Crows huge fines and suspensions, forcing the Sydney recruit to sit out half the 2013 season.\n\nNICK STEVENS TO COLLINGWOOD\n\nStevens was one of Port Adelaide’s best players when he declared he wanted to become a Collingwood player at the end of 2003. Port coach Mark Williams wasn’t having a bar of it, calling Stevens’ bluff and sending him to the pre-season draft, where he was picked up by Carlton. Port went on to win the 2004 premiership. “I obviously missed out on that but that’s the chance you take when you leave,” Stevens said years later. Any lingering sympathy for Stevens evaporated when he was jailed this year for violently assaulting his partner.\n\n","standFirst":"SOME of the most hyped deals in AFL history never made it to the start line.

Eagles","userOriginUpdated":"twomeyl1","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"West-Coast-not-chasing-Todd-Goldstein-but-talking-to-Nathan-Vardy-Will-Minson","revision":3,"body":"Reports suggesting Goldstein has gone through a medical check at West Coast have been categorically denied by both clubs and Goldstein’s management. \n\nThe 28-year-old has not been to Perth in the off-season. \n\nThe Kangaroos are adamant the All-Australian big man will not be traded and will line up for the Roos in Round 1 next season. \n\nHe has three children living in Melbourne. \n\nTRADE NEWS: HAMLING REQUESTS FREMANTLE MOVE\n\n‘TURMOIL’: CHAMP SAYS LEWIS TO DEMONS A DONE DEAL\n\nNOT DONE YET: BOMBERS STILL IN HUNT FOR JAEGER\n\nThe Eagles are searching for tall talent after losing ruckman Nic Naitanui and Scott Lycett to long-term injuries, but footy boss Craig Vozzo said the club was not making a play for Goldstein.\n\n“I reckon that one’s fiction, unless the coach is scheming something behind my back,” he said.\n\n“He’s a wonderful player, but to get a player like that to your football club requires a fair bit of planning and he’s not one we’re able to do.”\n\nPort Adelaide’s Matthew Lobbe is also not on West Coast’s radar, but Vozzo confirmed Geelong ruck-forward Nathan Vardy had visited the club during the week for medical tests and said he had also spoken to Bulldog Will Minson.\n\nDelisted North Melbourne veteran Drew Petrie is also in the mix.\n\n“He (Petrie) is someone we’ll consider during the (delisted) free agency period,” Vozzo told Perth radio station 6PR.\n\n“It will be largely dependant what we get through the door either through the next couple of weeks or the draft.\n\n“We’ve cast a pretty wide net ... we’ve spoken to managers of a number of players and a number of players as well.”\n\nVozzo said defender Mitch Brown would return to Victoria but Eric Mackenzie is likely to be wearing an Eagles jumper next season.\n\nBrown’s twin brother Nathan plays for Collingwood — although he remains out of contract — and his wife Shae has signed with the Magpies’ netball team.\n\n“Mitch is looking at all of his options and the preference is (living in) Melbourne. I’m not quite sure what he’s been able to organise, but I think he’s been in front of a couple of clubs so far via his manager Liam Pickering, so he’s likely heading east,” Vozzo said.\n\n“As we’ve said before, we’re very comfortable with Eric on our list. I think there is some interest from other clubs but the deal would have to be something that suits all parties for that to occur, otherwise he’ll be playing for us.”\n\nVozzo said the Eagles rated Docker Hayden Ballantyne highly but a small forward wasn’t a recruiting priority, and revealed more details of the shock trade for former Hawk Sam Mitchell.\n\n“We spoke to Hawthorn probably 12 months ago about speaking to Sam about life after playing, so I guess that’s the genesis of the idea.\n\n“Then over the last couple of weeks ... it escalated around the times of the Brownlow as a concept, then from there once Sam indicated it was something he would seriously consider, the parties got to work.”\n\n","standFirst":"UPDATE: West Coast says it is ‘casting a wide net’ to solve its big man crisis, but North Melbourne ruckman Todd Goldstein won’t be heading to Perth.\n\n","kicker":"Trade talk","byline":"Al Paton and Jay Clark","commentsAllowed":true,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":true,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["Al Paton and Jay Clark"],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":[]},{"contentType":"NEWS_STORY","id":{"value":"8ef406b90de48ceecc235cdea2ee3e2f","link":"http://api.newsapi.com.au/content/v2/8ef406b90de48ceecc235cdea2ee3e2f"},"originId":"c721f582-91cf-11e6-be1d-605c61a8be5f","origin":"METHODE","channel":"NONE","title":"Lees’ secret return to the Outback","subtitle":"Fifteen years on from the murder of Peter Falconio, Joanne Lees has quietly returned to Australia","description":"EXCLUSIVE\n\n","link":"http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/8ef406b90de48ceecc235cdea2ee3e2f?domain=newscorpaustralia.com","paidStatus":"PREMIUM","originalSource":"News Corp Australia Network","creditedSource":"news.com.au","subscriptionSummary":"EXCLUSIVE \n JOANNE Lees has slipped back into Australia on a mission to raise money for a roadside memorial to her murdered boyfriend Peter Falconio.

Australia","userOriginUpdated":"cresswellj","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Fifteen-years-on-from-the-murder-of-Peter-Falconio-Joanne-Lees-has-quiety-returned-to-Australia","revision":9,"body":"JOANNE Lees has slipped back into Australia on a mission to raise money for a roadside memorial to her murdered boyfriend Peter Falconio, hoping it will serve as a warning to foreign travellers of the risks of journeying in the Outback.\n\nMs Lees, 43, met with Aboriginal elders in the central Australian town of Ti Tree in August to discuss plans for what she calls a “Keeping Travellers Safe” memorial to Mr Falconio, who was executed on the Stuart Highway by Bradley Murdoch on July 14, 2001.\n\nShe also pleaded with Aborigines to keep the search alive for the remains of her boyfriend — a commitment they gave.\n\nMs Lees will hold a one-day, invitation-only sale of Aboriginal art at Melbourne’s Queen Victoria Women’s Centre on October 28 to raise money for the memorial, which will take the shape of a huge car-sized sculpture of a bird to be called “Falcon Dreaming”.\n\nMs Lees, who has been living under the radar in Sydney and Canberra since May, has chosen Ti Tree, 200km north of Alice Springs, for the memorial because it was the last place that she and Mr Falconio refuelled and watched the sunset together.\n\nEARLIER: Joanne Lees faces her Outback nightmare\n\nAboriginal informants from the area said Ms Lees told them she did not want to visit the murder site 100km further north near Barrow Creek, or to locate the memorial there, because she found the place “too painful”.\n\nIt is only the second time she has returned to central Australia since the murder — the last occasion was 2002, with a British TV crew. \n\nMurdoch flagged the British couple down as they drove slowly up the highway in their Kombi van and shot Mr Falconio dead. Police believe he wanted to kidnap and rape Ms Lees, who made a miraculous escape after being punched and restrained in Murdoch’s homemade handcuffs.\n\nThe bush visit and her coming art event — supported by 2015 Australian of the Year anti-violence campaigner Rosie Batty and to be opened by the British High Commissioner — have been shrouded in her customary desire for secrecy. \n\nAt Ti Tree, she spent the day talking to Aboriginal locals and stayed overnight. Some were asked not to talk to the media. \n\nMs Lees also visited the community of Yuendumu, where people have produced artworks to help her raise money to commission big-scale sculptor Ewen Coates to create the memorial.\n\nThe invitation states: “Joanne has returned to Australia to raise money for a permanent memorial to Peter, which will celebrate life and recognise his example — encouraging people to explore and embrace the world and cultures around them.”\n\nMs Lees travelled with Libby Andrew, the former police officer who stayed with her around the clock in Alice Springs in the aftermath of her 2001 ordeal. Ms Andrew was the only NT cop for whom Ms Lees had any fond words in her book, No Turning Back. \n\nIn Ti Tree, they reconnected with Gwen Brown, a former Aboriginal police aid from the community of Ali Curung, one of the first officers on the scene of the crime; and Aboriginal couple Pam Brown and Jasper Haines, who provided crucial testimony at Murdoch’s trial.\n\nPam Brown and Mr Haines, also from Ali Curung, saw Murdoch’s white four-wheel-drive Toyota near the orange Kombi as they drove past that night. Their evidence was crucial to corroborating Ms Lees’ description of the vehicle to police.\n\nMs Brown had never spoken to Ms Lees before this visit. “She was happy that she finally met her witnesses,” said Ms Brown. “We hugged each other.”\n\nMs Lees told Ms Brown the memorial was “to warn tourists of the dangers”. Ms Brown asked Ms Lees why the planned memorial would not be at Barrow Creek. “She said it was a bad memory.”\n\nMs Brown said when she first saw Ms Lees in Darwin she was “lonely and sad”. \n\nFifteen years on, she described her as “very happy” and anxious to make a connection with Aboriginal people.\n\nAnthony “Junior” Haines saw Ms Lees in Yuendumu. He said she was crying and spoke of having “a vision”, in which Mr Falconio told her she shouldn’t be in Yuendumu but closer to Ti Tree.\n\n“The vision was Peter saying to her, ‘You are in the wrong place. I didn’t vanish here,’” said Mr Haines. \n\nTi Tree tracker Dudley Hines said Ms Lees was anxious to know that people were still searching for Mr Falconio. \n\n“She was asking me if I’m still looking around,” he said. He told her he was.\n\nSeveral weeks ago he took police to a spot 30km north of the crime scene where women hunting for seeds to make necklaces said they had seen a hand coming out of the ground. \n\nBut the story had become tangled because the women had kept it quiet for more than a year, fearing that they could be attacked by Murdoch.\n\n“I told them that was silly,” said Mr Hines. “He’s in jail and he’s not coming out. \n\nMurdoch, jailed for a minimum 28 years in 2005, has refused to reveal the location of Mr Falconio’s remains.\n\n“You got to find that body,” Mr Hines said. “You got to send him back to his parents in England.”\n\nMs Andrew said Ms Lees would not comment. It is understood she has engaged a PR agency to sell exclusive rights to the story of her return to Australia.\n\nNovember 15, 2000: Peter Falconio and Joanne Lees leave their English home on their round-the-world trip, arriving in Australia two months later.\n\nJune 2001: The couple begin their driving holiday in their 30-year-old orange VW Kombi van in Sydney. \n\nJuly 14, 2001, 6.20pm: Falconio and Lees stop at Ti Tree to buy fuel and watch the red centre sunset and share a joint. About 100km further on, a man in a white four-wheel drive waves them over, and Mr Falconio disappears, believed shot dead. Ms Lees is threatened with a gun, punched and handcuffed before escaping and hiding in the bush for several hours, until she waves down a road train. \n\nJuly 15, 2001: NT police launch a search for Mr Falconio and the gunman. They find a pool of Mr Falconio’s blood covered with dirt beside the highway near Barrow Creek.\n\nEarly 2003: About 2500 people identified as “persons of interest”.\n\nNovember 14, 2003: Broome mechanic Bradley John Murdoch is charged.\n\nMay 2005: Testing in Britain on part of the cable tie handcuffs finds a DNA sample is 100 million times more likely to have come from Murdoch than anyone else.\n\nDecember 13, 2005: Murdoch is convicted of murdering Mr Falconio, assaulting Ms Lees and depriving her of her liberty. He is jailed for life with a minimum 28 years non-parole. His appeal two years later is dismissed.\n\nAugust 15, 2007: Reports that Murdoch’s family wants him moved to a WA jail prompts the State Government to deny receiving any such application.\n\n","standFirst":"EXCLUSIVE: Fifteen years on from the murder of her boyfriend Peter Falconio, Joanne Lees has quietly returned to Australia on a heartfelt mission with a twin

Meares retires: Olympic cyclist, flag-bearer ends career","userOriginUpdated":"benammare","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Champion-Australian-track-cyclist-Anna-Meares-announces-her-retirement","revision":14,"body":"The two-time Olympic gold medallist has revealed she required six cortisone injections in her spine just to get to a fourth Games in Rio where she won a bronze medal in the keirin final.\n\nAt 33 and after 11 world titles, six Olympic medals and 35 national championships, Meares is preparing to embark on life after cycling which includes charity and media work.\n\n“The reason I took some time to myself after Rio, I wanted to remove myself from that environment and get over some of the emotions attached with the Olympic Games,” Meares said.\n\n“A factor in that was the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and whether I would ride on (to that). Having looked back and seen what I have achieved and assessed some of the injuries I had going into Rio — some people aren’t aware just to get to Rio I had six cortisone injections through my spine, had to change tact for six months.\n\n“I have to feel satisfied and happy to step aside from the sport and try something new and different.\n\n“I am really proud of my longevity, also proud of the level of high consistency in my performances and results during my career.\n\n“It is hard to close this chapter, because it is a bloody big one, but I am really excited about the doors opening in to the next chapter of my life.”\n\nMeares is the most successful female track cyclist in history and the most successful Australian cyclist in Olympic history as the only rider to medal in four consecutive Games.\n\nMoving forward she will mentor some of Cycling Australia’s emerging young riders and is also planning to do a charity ride with former Australian cricket captain Steve Waugh.\n\nWhen asked about a standout moment from her glittering career, Meares said: \n\n“It is hard to go past that gold medal win against Victoria Pendleton and the high performance program at Cycling Australia to make that win. \n\n“It is (also) hard to go past that silver in Beijing after my accident a few months prior.”\n\nIn Rio, Meares still managed to win Australian cycling’s only individual medal of the Games with bronze in the women’s keirin final.\n\nThere is no doubt that Meares goes out as a hugely respected and valued member of the Australian team having led the Aussies and carried the flag at the opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games and this year’s Rio Olympics.\n\n","standFirst":"ANNA Meares has confirmed her retirement from cycling saying she would have

Cahill derby goal video: Melbourne City goal v Victory among Cahill’s best","userOriginUpdated":"burkedg","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Tim-Cahill-says-Melbourne-Derby-strike-among-the-best-goals-of-his-career","revision":10,"body":"The glamour goal is still the talk of Melbourne but Cahill told Nova 100’s Chrissie, Sam & Browny this morning that it could not top the thunderous volley against the Dutch.\n\nMORE: Tim Cahill’s top five career goals\n\n“I’d have to say it’s probably second on my list,” Cahill told the radio station.\n\n“Netherlands was probably one of my best goals.”\n\n“When I hit it, I’ve said time and time again I either hit row Z or it hits the back of the net.”\n\nMORE: Cahill comes and Cahill conquers\n\nCity continues to bask in the afterglow of its 4-1 derby trouncing of Victory, a win that has moved the club in to A-League favouritism.\n\n“It was amazing, my first experience, first A-League Game,” Cahill said.\n\n“The fans, it was crazy, Melbourne Victory-Melbourne City: we knew there was a lot on the line, there was lot of pressure on us as a team.\n\n“It was an awesome night, that’s what football is all about.”\n\nAnd although Cahill was putting a lid on title talk when he fronted media on Sunday, he was more happy to speak about the 27th minute wonder strike that has reverberated around the world and is sure to be replayed ad nauseum for the rest of the season. \n\nCahill, alongside City captain Bruno Fornaroli before the team’s recovery session yesterday morning, said headers such as the one Fornaroli scored on Saturday are more his artform.\n\nBut the 36-year-old did say the sweetly struck volley rated alongside goals like his similarly audacious strike against the Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup, his 2006 World Cup double against Japan and his 2015 Asian Cup bicycle kick against China. \n\nAfter the ball bobbled up following a pair of headers from Fornaroli and Victory defender James Donachie, Cahill — with Carl Valeri for company — launched a right-footed half volley that scythed through the air and in to the top right corner. \n\n“I think it’s up there,” Cahill said.\n\nMORE: Cahill’s goal ignites Melbourne Derby\n\n“You’re in the game and that’s what I’ve done my whole career. It’s just a moment and I’ve taken it.\n\n“We said before the game, just before we went out, we watched a video that the goalkeeper likes to take chances, he likes to come out. \n\n“It’s a 4-3-3 and he wants to be a sweeper, any half a chance (we’d take).\n\n“You saw as soon as the ball was bouncing I changed my speed, I could just see him, I didn’t even look up too much, and he got caught.\n\nMORE: The top five goals of Tim Cahill’s career\n\n“We just wanted to keep him honest and in the end it kept him back. It was a great goal.”\n\nMuscat said there was no need for “a witch hunt” following Cahill’s wonder strike.\n\n“I don’t think it would have mattered where (Thomas) stood,” Muscat said.\n\n“It’s landed in the top corner at about 90mph. If you’re looking to blame someone for that, blame me.\n\n“Don’t blame Lawrence, because I asked him to stand there.”\n\nEven though Melbourne Victory coach Kevin Muscat refused to blame his goalkeeper’s positioning on Saturday night, Cahill revealed that Melbourne City players watched vision of Lawrence Thomas and his tendency to be off his line no less than an hour before his 35m bomb. \n\nCity coach John van’t Schip also marvelled at the goal.\n\n“It’s something world class players do,” van’t Schip said.\n\n“Tim saw the moment. He had an eye for it and of course you have to have the quality to hit the ball the right way and you need a bit of luck. \n\n“Everything came together in a great moment.”\n\nMORE: Australia’s greatest soccer exports\n\n","standFirst":"WE’VE all wondered where Tim Cahill’s remarkable long-range strike ranks among his list of greatest goals.

Bishop tells Stellar: ‘Why should I apologise for being feminine?’","userOriginUpdated":"obrienjo","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Julie-Bishop-I-dont-let-other-people-define-me","revision":9,"body":"She pulls up another pic from the New York trip — Bishop is with three other female foreign ministers, who are all laughing. “There we all are, waving at [Canadian Prime Minister] Justin Trudeau.” She scrolls along to a picture of herself, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry at a recent meeting about Syria. “There’s me, there’s Lavrov, there’s Kerry. Can you imagine? Tense. The body language tells you everything.”\n\nWith her Tom Ford sunglasses, star-studded contact list and a figure most 20-year-olds would envy, Bishop is the kind of foreign minister many of us would like to be. She is one of the best performers of the Coalition government: hardworking, assertive and charming, able to banter with divisive UK politician Boris Johnson, stand up to the Russians, and fight for Australia’s interests in the most intimidating forums in the world. But she also has a handsome partner, a designer wardrobe (Sally at Armani has her credit card details and size), and is unashamedly feminine.\n\n“She presents the most sophisticated image on the world stage that Australia has ever presented,” observes Vogue Australia editor-in-chief Edwina McCann, who works with Bishop on the Australian Fashion Chamber. “It’s an image that a lot of young women would aspire to.”\n\nBishop arrives for her Stellar photo shoot in Sydney with a pile of Armani clothes from her own wardrobe. A mild stand-off with the Stellar editorial team ensues; she wants to wear her own clothing, they want her to wear the clothing the fashion editor has brought. Bishop gives a glimpse of the assertiveness she presumably takes into cabinet meetings. “I am not a model,” she says archly. “I am a foreign minister.”\n\nAfter a further exchange, she uses her diplomatic skills to negotiate a compromise. She rejects a leather skirt and black cut-out shoulder top, but agrees to try the items on the stylist’s rack that she might have selected herself. Peace deal successfully brokered, everyone gets to work.\n\nMagazine photo shoots like this one have traditionally been dangerous territory for women in politics — hence, perhaps, Bishop’s caution. Australia doesn’t like its female politicians being too female.\n\nThe list of casualties is long. In recent years, Labor frontbencher Kate Ellis was excoriated for wearing high heels in a magazine shoot with Grazia, while Anna Bligh was accused of putting personal publicity ahead of Queensland when the then-premier agreed to a two-hour photo shoot with The Australian Women’s Weekly in 2011.\n\nBishop, however, seems to be in a league of her own. Not only has she graced the pages of Vogue Australia, Harper’s Bazaar and Marie Claire, but she loves clothes, likes to look good and enjoys reading fashion magazines. Unlike those who have come before her, the woman featured in those glossies, wearing Armani and Kailis pearls, is the real Julie Bishop.\n\n“I don’t think we should apologise for our femininity,” she says. “I don’t think we should apologise for our interest in fashion. I have always loved fashion and beautiful clothes and magazines and all of that, that doesn’t mean I can’t have a serious career and hold deeply complex, serious conversations about world events with people. To suggest you can’t do both is insulting.\n\n“The most positive feedback I get tends to be from young women, who say, ‘That’s what I want to hear. I don’t want to hear that I have to apologise for who I am; I want to be able to back my own intuition, my own judgment, have confidence in my beliefs and who I am.’ If you are confident, if you are relaxed in your own skin, don’t let them define you. Don’t let other people define you.”\n\nPerhaps it’s the confidence that comes with a second term in a job she loves, but Bishop is revealing more of her personality than ever before. The rainbow set of boxy jackets she wore in Opposition is giving way to edgier fashion choices, such as the suit with shorts she wore to meet British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. (“It’s this year’s fashion, so I wore them,” she says. “It didn’t occur to me at the time that I was making some kind of statement.”)\n\nWe see fewer death stares, and more emojis. She sits in the front row at the David Jones fashion show. This year, she’ll sandwich Derby Day between meetings and a sitting of parliament. She was rarely photographed with her last boyfriend, former Perth Lord Mayor Peter Nattrass, but she is regularly out and about with her partner of two years, the rather dashing former pharmacist David Panton, who sometimes travels with her. “He’s a very special person in my life,” says Bishop. Funny? Smart? “All of that,” she replies with a coy smile.\n\nOne former colleague says Bishop is not above using her femininity as an asset. “She can be flirty,” he says. “The persona changes, and the blokes like it. I’ve seen it work. She knows how to use it.”\n\nBishop’s enemies — and she does have them within her party, mostly allies of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott who believe, despite her denials, that she betrayed him — accuse her of being starstruck. They say she loves parties and globetrotting and celebrities a little too much.\n\nBut supporters argue there’s no reason why she can’t play as well as work. It might \n\neven be an advantage.\n\n“The personal relationships and connections you are able to establish, the longer you are in the role, actually work very much in the interests of the country,” says Bishop. “Because if you are able to establish a rapport, a common interest, and continue to follow them up and remain in contact, there are many times when I have been able to use that personal contact to get through to someone, to ask if they will take a matter into account, to promote Australia’s interests in circumstances you might not otherwise have been able to. I swap mobile phone numbers as often as possible.”\n\nBishop likes some labels, but rejects others. She likes Armani and Rachel Gilbert and Escada, but she doesn’t like to be called a feminist. When asked why, she bristles. “I just don’t use labels to describe myself,” she says. \n\n“If you want to know what I stand for, I am a Liberal. Where do I come from? I am a West Australian. What do I do? I am a foreign minister. Beyond that, I tend not to self-describe. I don’t call myself a Marxist, I don’t call myself a feminist, I don’t call myself a range of things. If others wish to, that’s fine. I don’t know why this is even raised, I must say.”\n\nIt’s raised because Bishop is, whether she likes the term feminist or not, a trailblazer for women. She’s the first female Australian foreign minister, and the first woman to be the deputy leader of the Liberal party. She’s held that job since 2007, under three leaders and through three leadership changes.\n\nShe is also a champion of women. In July, she appointed the first female Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. She employs women on her staff. She is not, according to those who have worked with her, the type to climb up and kick down.\n\nBishop also uses her position to promote equal opportunity. “Julie has ensured that gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are a central part of Australia’s foreign policy and international development work,” says former Democrats leader and Australia’s Ambassador for Women and Girls, Natasha Stott Despoja.\n\nThe foreign minister was the first person in parliament in whom Minister for Revenue and Financial Services Kelly O’Dwyer confided she was pregnant. “When you have exciting news like that, there is also caution about how you go about telling people,” says O’Dwyer. “[Julie] was a source of advice to me at the time, and a source of support. She will listen, she will keep a confidence, and she will problem-solve.”\n\nBishop is sensitive to the struggles of women balancing work and family. She says former Prime Minister John Howard was just stating a fact when he said recently that women’s ability to participate in politics is constrained by their role in caring for others.\n\n“The point he didn’t go on and make was how can we ensure that federal parliament can be more family friendly, so women can take part in politics,” she states. “It’s not only parliament, it’s the 24/7 nature of the job, and I don’t know if that’s often understood. You are essentially on call seven days a week.”\n\nPoliticians can make childcare more affordable and tailor parental leave schemes to the needs of men and women, but the real change, she says, must come from the bottom up. “Policy considerations are one thing, attitudes are another,” she says. “You could have all of the policies available, but unless people are prepared to change the roles and be more flexible, it will all come to naught.”\n\nBishop works in a world that’s still jam-packed with men. Most of her meetings are with blokes in suits, sometimes in countries in which women are still at the bottom of the power food chain. When she visits those countries, she is pragmatic.\n\nIn Iran, she would not have been allowed into the meetings without a hijab. So she covered her head — a decision that prompted criticism at home — but chose a sparkly scarf by Armani with which to do it. “In all meetings, you have to be confident, hold your ground, and not take a backwards step,” she says. “That’s not about being a woman, that’s about representing your country.”\n\nBishop believes that any woman who can reach the heights of foreign minister — or prime minster, or prime minister’s chief of staff (Bishop says she never saw Peta Credlin, Tony Abbott’s former chief of staff, being subject to sexism; “I didn’t observe it”) – cannot claim to have been discriminated against because of their gender. “Of course there is always language or situations or things that are said or done,” she says. “It runs through your mind, ‘Would that have occurred if I were male?’ But I don’t let it get to me.”\n\nOne would almost pity the man who tried that on with Bishop. She thrives on challenging situations. Within weeks of becoming foreign minister, she was wielding the gavel at the United Nations Security Council. I ask whether she was nervous. “It was amazing,” she says.\n\nShe was an active participant during the aforementioned meeting at which John Kerry and Sergei Lavrov argued over Syria. “I made a contribution, but I was witness to the exchanges between the US rep and the Russian rep, and you realise you are observing history in the making,” she says. “The significance of the events I am involved in doesn’t escape me.”\n\nShe happily name-drops, at Stellar’s invitation. Barack Obama, she says, is “very easy to get along with”. Hillary Clinton is “very professional, very charming, very direct”. Boris Johnson “is very intelligent, very quick-witted, but is also taking his role as foreign secretary very seriously”.\n\n“There are some fascinating people I have met. Challenging. Interesting. Charming. Robust.” Such as? “The Russian foreign minister.”\n\nBishop is not nervous about a Donald Trump presidency. She met with his representatives during her last US visit. “I am pragmatic. You have to work with the hand you are dealt. You can’t wish the world to be the way you want it to be, you work with the world that is.”\n\nThe foreign minister spends half her time overseas, a quarter in Canberra, and a quarter in Perth. The power plays in Canberra might not be as compelling as those in the United Nations, but they are just as important for a senior member of a government with a slim majority. Voters like Bishop, as do political donors. Some in her party do, some don’t. She says her ambition is to remain as foreign minister, but she won’t be drawn on whether she’d have a tilt at the leadership if the opportunity arose.\n\n“I have fulfilled every ambition I had in politics, and that was to be foreign minister,” she explains. “It’s not a question of wanting to [be leader]. There are literally dozens of people who want to be the prime minister, who want to be the leader, and it’s determined by events far more than ambition.”\n\nHer friends say she doesn’t have her eye on the top job. “She has no ambition to be the leader of the party at some point in the future, but in my view she is extremely capable of being so,” says Brendan Nelson, the first Liberal leader Bishop served under as deputy.\n\nBishop makes her job look glamorous, but it’s gruelling, too. She works non-stop. On some trips she’s away for three of four nights, and catches all her sleep on planes. She copes by staying fit — she’s a keen runner — and eating well.\n\nShe celebrated her 60th birthday in July with no regrets, but excitement about what lay ahead. “I have a very challenging career, I have a very satisfying personal life, I am enjoying every moment of it,” she says. “I feel fit and healthy, and I am loving life.” \n\n","standFirst":"AUSTRALIA doesn’t like its female politicians to be too female.

streets before the main 42km event got under way at 7am this morning.\n\nMORE: Get a taste of a remarkable Melbourne Marathon From the Cheap Seats\n\nThe course started along Brunton Ave and runners crossed the finish line on the hallowed turf of the MCG. \n\nRunning his first ever Marathon, Thomas Do Canto was a shock winner.\n\nCanto, 30, crossed the MCG finish line in a time of 2hrs, 20mins, 53 secs, a time he said was blown out by windswept conditions across the 42.2km course.\n\nVictorian Virginia Moloney won the women’s race in 2:34.28.\n\nMaintaining his position among the leading three or four for much of the race, NSW runner Do Canto sensed his opportunity around the 34km mark when half marathon leader Ben Moreau became a quasi pacesetter for a couple of kilometres.\n\nDo Canto ultimately streeted away to win by two minutes and 23 seconds from Jack Colreavy.\n\nMatthew Cox finished third in 2:24.05.\n\n“I’m just rapt, I wasn’t expecting this,” Do Canto said.\n\n“Earlier in the year I did an ultra marathon on the trails, 45km.\n\n“But it’s quite different on the road, on the flat, you’re running at a pretty hard pace.\n\n“It was a relentless pace and it was quite windy, so this harder. The conditions definitely made it a lot slower, that headwind coming back towards St Kilda was ridiculous. It hit me like a brick wall.\n\n“It gave us a tailwind for a good section of it, but you can’t make up that time.”\n\nMoloney, 26, won from Sinead Diver (+6.47mins) and Victoria Beck (+11.34)\n\n“That was unbelievable,” Moloney said.\n\n“That was so challenging, but I’m just over the moon. It’s not quite as fast as I wanted to go, but in those conditions I am just stoked.”\n\nAustralian Brett Robinson won the half marathon while Eloise Wellings was the first female to cross the line. \n\nOlympic Gold medallist Cathy Freeman ran the 10km, while Postcards host Brodie Harper ran the full marathon. \n\nThe marathon led to road closures along St Kilda Rd, Beach Rd and Batman Ave\n\nbrianna.travers@news.com.au\n\n","standFirst":"A RUNNER taking on his first ever marathon has crossed the finish line ahead of more than 32,000 other racers in the Melbourne Marathon this

deadline.\n\n‘TURMOIL’: CHAMP SAYS LEWIS TO DEMONS A DONE DEAL\n\nGOING HOME: HAMLING REQUESTS TRADE TO FREMANTLE\n\nWho’s chasing who? And who’s going where? All the latest in a our club-by-club guide.\n\nADELAIDE\n\nGAINED: Nil\n\nLOST: Nil\n\nThe Crows made a splash on the opening day of the trade period, announcing Carlton’s Bryce Gibbs was keen on a move home to South Australia. However, in trying to force the Blues’ hand, they’ve buggered it up. Now Carlton has reportedly called off trade talks and the Crows could end the trade period without the quality midfielder they so desperately need. However, there could be redemption for Adelaide if they are able to secure Brisbane captain Tom Rockliff. On the other hand, it could get worse for the Crows if archrivals Port Adelaide are able to swoop in and claim Gibbs.\n\nBRISBANE LIONS\n\nGAINED: Picks 3, 16\n\nLOST: Picks 2, 31, 51, 60\n\nAt first glance it doesn’t look good for Brisbane. Captain Tom Rockliff’s future is in serious doubt and star Irishman Pearce Hanley is suffering “losers fatigue” and will be traded to Gold Coast. However, when you look at the picks the Lions will take to November’s draft it starts to look a little rosier. At the halfway mark of the AFL trade period the Lions hold picks 3, 16, 19 and 21 and will snare more premium picks for Hanley and possibly Rockliff. Throw in the rumour Billy Hartung could arrive as part of the Jaeger O’Meara/Pearce Hanley trade and you’re pretty happy as a Lions fan. Defenders Jack Frost and Lynden Dunn should come cheap.\n\nCARLTON\n\nGAINED: Nil\n\nLOST: Nil\n\nThe Blues were stunned on the opening day of the trade period when star midfielder Bryce Gibbs and the Crows dropped a bombshell — that he wanted to head home to South Australia. Carlton isn’t keen on losing the former No. 1 pick unless it can secure another gun onballer. Zach Tuohy has also requested a trade and wants to join Geelong, with the Blues eyeing Darcy Lang in an exchange. Caleb Marchbank should get his wish to land at Ikon Park but what that deal looks like is unclear. The Blues don’t want to part with pick 5 but could give that up if fellow Giant Jarrod Pickett is included in the deal. If Gibbs is traded to the Crows in a deal that includes Adelaide’s first pick, No. 13, then they could pass that on to GWS for Marchbank. Have also been linked to another Giant, forward James Stewart.\n\nCOLLINGWOOD\n\nGAINED: Daniel Wells, Chris Mayne\n\nLOST: Nathan Brown\n\nThe Pies have secured Daniel Wells and Chris Mayne via free agency but there’s still plenty of action to come at the Holden Centre, with Travis Cloke and Jack Frost certain to be traded to the Western Bulldogs and Brisbane Lions respectively. The Pies want Giant Will Hoskin-Elliott but are yet to talk with GWS, while Jonathon Marsh wants to move back to Western Australia but the Dockers and Eagles aren’t keen. The club’s backline stocks took another hit at the weekend with Nathan Brown heading to St Kilda as a free agent. The Pies said on Sunday they wouldn’t match the Saints’ offer. And ruckman Jarrod Witts is bound for Gold Coast. Marley Williams does not have a contract offer in front of him from Collingwood but interest from rival clubs in the defender has been limited. Were linked to Lions captain Tom Rockliff and reportedly offered up midfielder Levi Greenwood as part of a deal, but that was rejected.\n\nESSENDON\n\nGAINED: Nil\n\nLOST: Nil\n\nWere not expected to be huge players this trade period in the lead-up and that’s what’s happened so far. Will seal a deal with Melbourne to exchange Michael Hibberd for a second-round pick, whether it’s in this year’s draft or next year’s remains the sticking point. Have reportedly shown interest in Giant James Stewart. Missed out on Jaeger O’Meara but are keeping a close eye on talks between Hawthorn and Gold Coast and are ready to swoop should the deal break down. Were in the mix for Koby Stevens but he opted for St Kilda.\n\nFREMANTLE\n\nGAINED: Bradley Hill, Cam McCarthy, picks 7, 34, 72\n\nLOST: Chris Mayne, pick 3 \n\nPoised to be one of the big winners out of this year’s trade period, the Dockers have already secured targets Cam McCarthy — sliding just four spots in the top 10 to get him — plus Bradley Hill. Were resigned to losing Chris Maybe but effectively got Hill in exchange for him after sending that compensation pick to Hawthorn for the wingman. Cat Shane Kersten should also get to the Dockers to play alongside McCarthy. Will also get Bulldog premiership hero Joel Hamling to slot into defence but doesn’t have interest in Magpie Jonathon Marsh. Hayden Ballantyne looks like he’ll stay despite being interested in a move, but Michael Barlow looks done.\n\nGEELONG\n\nGAINED: Nil\n\nLOST: Nil\n\nThe Cats are working feverishly behind closed doors to get deals done to get Brett Deledio and Zach Tuohy, but are facing an uphill battle with little to offer in draft picks and a tight salary cap. Josh Caddy’s name has been thrown up in the Deledio deal and he’s said to be open to a move if Geelong want to trade him, but they’re not keen on parting with required players. The Blues want Darcy Lang in exchange for Tuohy but the youngster has shown glimpses. The Cats’ first pick in this year’s draft is No. 38.\n\nGOLD COAST SUNS\n\nGAINED: Nil\n\nLOST: Nil\n\nJaeger O’Meara and Dion Prestia are the big names leaving the Suns and holding up other trades as we enter the second week. The Hawks have now got hold of St Kilda’s pick No. 10 which will likely feature in the O’Meara deal, but Gold Coast also want a player. Luke Breust, Liam Shiels, James Sicily, Billy Hartung and Will Langford have all been thrown up as possible targets. The Suns want Richmond’s pick No. 6 in return for Prestia and are likely get it as talks ramp up, although Prestia is open to staying should the deal fall over. Pearce Hanley is expected to bolster the midfield and half-backline but a deal with the Lions probably won’t be done until the O’Meara trade is completed. Magpie Jarrod Witts should be added to the list in exchange for a second or third-round draft pick. Port Adelaide’s Brendon Ah Chee wants to join his brother Callum at the Suns and could be acquired cheaply. Showed interest in Hamish Hartlett but he now wants to stay at the Power. Also missed out on Lin Jong as the midfielder opted to stay at the Bulldogs. \n\nGWS\n\nGAINED: Picks 2, 31, 51, 60, 2017 second-round pick\n\nLOST: Jack Steele, picks 3, 16.\n\nHave been busy already and there’s more to come, with deals likely to send Caleb Marchbank, Jarrod Pickett (both want to join Carlton), Will-Hoskin Elliott (Collingwood), Paul Ahern (North Melbourne) and James Stewart (Carlton or Essendon) to new homes. That will add to the Giants’ stockpile of draft picks, with a pick swap completed already to move up one place on November 25 to pick 2 with the aim of snaring junior star Andy McGrath as well as academy guns Will Setterfield, Harry Perryman and Harrison Macreadie.\n\nHAWTHORN\n\nGAINED: Tyrone Vickery, Tom Mitchell, picks 10, 23, 57, 68\n\nLOST: Sam Mitchell, Bradley Hill, picks 23, 36, 52, 70, 88, 2017 first-round pick\n\nWow. Sam Mitchell is a big out but Tom Mitchell is a big in. So are the Hawks big winners or losers? It all hinges on Jaeger O’Meara and Jordan Lewis. If the Suns star arrives and Lewis stays, Graham Wright will be hailed a hero. If O’Meara falls into the pre-season draft and Lewis wears red and blue in 2017, the Hawks’ dynasty is in danger of collapsing. The second week of the trade period will be a nerve-racking time for Hawks fans.\n\nMELBOURNE:\n\nGAINED: Nil\n\nLOST: Nil\n\nA trade for Essendon’s Michael Hibberd was expected to be one of the first of the trade period. Both sides have publicly said they will play nice and the Dees’ pick 29 is a fair price, so it’s not clear what the holdup is. Maybe the Dees are busy trying to get a trade over the line for Hawthorn champ Jordan Lewis, who met new Demons coach Simon Goodwin after coach Alastair Clarkson suggested he explore his options. The Hawks now say Lewis is a “contracted and required player” but he is far from secure at Hawthorn, with manager Liam Pickering confirming on Saturday he is speaking to both clubs. At 30, Lewis doesn’t fit the Dees’ age profile but his experience would be ideal for a rising Melbourne team that should challenge for finals in 2017. Lynden Dunn to Brisbane should also happen before Thursday’s 2pm deadline.\n\nNORTH MELBOURNE\n\nGAINED: Nil\n\nLOST: Daniel Wells\n\nThe Kangaroos’ disastrous end to the season continued into the trade period as star midfielder Daniel Wells walked away in free agency, signing a rich deal with Collingwood. We can’t knock the Roos for not signing Wells on big money, he does have a history of injury. However, it’s another star gone. Have their eye on Bulldog Nathan Hrovat and untried Giants talent Paul Ahern while Drew Petrie could play on at West Coast.\n\nPORT ADELAIDE\n\nGAINED: Nil\n\nLOST: Nil\n\nPort Adelaide finished the season ninth and were making lots of noise heading into the AFL trade period, with a range of players on the trading block including vice-captain Hamish Hartlett. However, after visiting several clubs, Hartlett backflipped on a move away from Alberton and the Power could end up with egg on their collective faces. Port wanted picks to reinvest in the draft — it currently holds picks 9, 49 and 67 — and at the moment all they’ve got is hot air. The second week will be very interesting to see if they can not only cut some of the fat but also snare some valuable draft picks to rebuild a clogged list. One player who could leave is Brendon Ah Chee, who wants to play with his brother at Gold Coast.\n\nRICHMOND\n\nGAINED: Pick 27\n\nLOST: Tyrone Vickery\n\nShould land Dion Prestia from Gold Coast despite some wobbles late in week one. Look certain to hand over pick 6 but hope to get one of the Suns’ grab-bag of draft selections back in return, possibly pick 30. The other item on the agenda is a potential trade for club champion Brett Deledio to Geelong. The Tigers have asked for Josh Caddy but the Cats aren’t keen on handing him over in a straight swap. Deledio is contracted and might stay put, although that could be awkward with talks progressing this far. The Western Bulldogs have flatly denied rumours they are chasing the 29-year-old. Lost Ty Vickery to Hawthorn in the first free agency move and have to be happy with the compensation which gets them back into the second round of the draft. Might get Swan Toby Nankervis for a late pick. Reece Conca is set to re-sign and Ben Lennon is exploring his options, but not generating a lot of interest so far.\n\nST KILDA\n\nGAINED: Jack Steele, Nathan Brown, picks 23, 36 and Hawthorn’s future first-round pick\n\nLOST: Pick 10, 68, future second-round pick\n\nQuietly going about their business, targeting two big-bodied midfielders to add depth and some physical presence to help the likes of Seb Ross and Jack Steven. The first, Jack Steele, is already at Seaford after a deal with GWS for a future second-round draft pick. The second, Koby Stevens, will follow soon most likely for one of the two second-rounders this year the Saints received in a smart pick swap with Hawthorn on Friday. The Saints have also bolstered its backline by signing Collingwood premiership player Nathan Brown as a free agent. St Kilda isn’t planning on giving anyone up, with list boss Ameet Bains knocking on the head rumours surrounding David Armitage, Billy Longer and Tom Hickey. \n\nSYDNEY SWANS\n\nGAINED: Pick 14, pick 52\n\nLOST: Tom Mitchell, pick 57\n\nLosing Mitchell is a blow but one the Swans were prepared for, with pick 14 a reasonable price. The focus is on retaining players like uncontracted back-up ruckman Toby Nankervis, who is likely to move to Richmond or the Bulldogs. Dean Towers is in a similar boat but there hasn’t been a lot of reported interest. Trading Kurt Tippett has been floated as a way to ease salary cap pressure but the Swans say that definitely isn’t happening. The Swans aren’t targeting any top-line talent and will back in draft guru Kinnear Beatson. \n\nWEST COAST EAGLES\n\nGAINED: Sam Mitchell, Picks 54, 72\n\nLOST: Picks 52, 70, 88\n\nThe focus is on what’s happening at Hawthorn but the massive winners are the Eagles, who just had a champion midfielder fall in their lap. Mitchell is 34 but just played arguably the best season of his career and will top up an onball brigade already boasting Matt Priddis, Luke Shuey and Andrew Gaff. When Nic Nat returns, look out. In the meantime, the Eagles are looking for a ruckman, with Nathan Vardy, Drew Petrie and Will Minson on the short list. Despite the rumour mill going into overdrive on Friday, list boss Craig Vozzo says they aren’t chasing Kangaroo Todd Goldstein. A mooted cross-town trade for Hayden Ballantyne seems to have fallen over. Mitch Brown is returning home to Victoria and there is interest in Eric Mackenzie. \n\nWESTERN BULLDOGS\n\nGAINED: Nil\n\nLOST: Nil\n\nNo paperwork yet but set to be very active in the closing days. Koby Stevens has requested a trade to St Kilda, which will get done probably for pick 36 or 50. Premiership defender Joel Hamling has requested a trade to Fremantle after agonising over the decision, the Dockers’ pick 43 sounds about right as a swap. The Dogs are also set to lose Nathan Hrovat to either Carlton or North Melbourne for a late pick. One of those selections will head to Collingwood in return for Travis Cloke. Marcus Adams has requested a move home to WA for family reasons but with Hamling leaving the Dogs are unlikely to let the contracted defender go. Will Minson could get a lifeline at the Eagles but the Dogs won’t get anything for him.\n\n","standFirst":"IT HAS been a trade period full of bombshells so far but not many deals have been completed ... yet.

leapfrogged Tottenham Hotspur into second place after their arch north London rivals also dropped points in a 1-1 draw away to West Bromwich Albion. \n\nFollowing fouls by Phil Jagielka, Everton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg saved penalties from Kevin de Bruyne and Sergio Aguero -- his second spot-kick failure this week after he was off target in Argentina’s World Cup qualifying defeat by Paraguay. \n\nRomelu Lukaku then fired the visitors ahead in the 64th minute at Eastlands before substitute Aguero’s miss.\n\nBut City, who’ve now gone three games without a win in all competitions, equalised in the 72nd minute when Nolito headed in Silva’s cross as former Barcelona team-mates turned managers Pep Guardiola (City) and Ronald Koeman (Everton) had to settle for a point apiece. \n\n“We did absolutely everything -- Everton create just one chance which was a goal,” said Guardiola.\n\n“The players have all the qualities to score penalties but we miss a lot. Hopefully we will score more of them in future.” \n\nChelsea hammered champions Leicester City 3-0 at Stamford Bridge thanks to goals from Diego Costa, Eden Hazard and Victor Moses. \n\nDefeat meant the Foxes had won just two of their eight league games this season and manager Claudio Ranieri, a former Chelsea boss, said: “Our approach to the match was not good.” \n\nAt the Emirates, Theo Walcott scored twice as Arsenal defeated Swansea for a sixth straight win in all competitions. \n\nTottenham dominated possession at The Hawthorns only for former Spurs star Nacer Chadli to put the Baggies ahead eight minutes from time. \n\nBut Dele Alli’s 89th-minute equaliser preserved Spurs’ unbeaten league record. \n\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said: “We missed the opportunity to achieve three points but in the same way it was a difficult game.”\n\nStoke won in the league for the first time this season as Wales international Joe Allen made it four goals in his last three games by scoring twice in a 2-0 win at home to basement club Sunderland. \n\nWest Ham climbed out of the relegation zone with a 1-0 win away to London rivals Crystal Palace in Saturday’s late kick-off. \n\nBournemouth thrashed Hull 6-1 as Mike Phelan’s first game in full-time charge of the Tigers ended in an a thumping defeat. \n\nWhy Foxes treated Chelsea game as unimportant\n\nWhy Conte ignored ‘aggressive’ Costa’s request\n\nStunning verdict to floor City’s rivals\n\nGAME-BY-GAME HIGHLIGHTS\n\nMANCHESTER CITY 1, EVERTON 1\n\nNolito’s header saved a point for a dominant Manchester City side as the Premier League leaders had two penalties saved in a 1-1 draw at home to Everton on Saturday. \n\nEverton’s Romelu Lukaku scored on the break 19 minutes into the second half after Ronald Koeman’s visitors had absorbed sustained pressure Everton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg, who had saved a first-half penalty from Kevin De Bruyne, then blocked another from Sergio Aguero. \n\nBut the goalkeeper was finally beaten as Nolito, on as a substitute for only a minute, headed in David Silva’s cross in the 72nd minute. \n\nARSENAL 3, SWANSEA CITY 2\n\nTheo Walcott struck in the 27th minute after Jordi Amat failed to clear Hector Bellerin’s headed cross.\n\nThe England international doubled the Gunners’ lead seven minutes later following Hull’s failure to clear a corner.\n\nSwansea, in former United States manager Bob Bradley’s first game in charge, saw Gylfi Sigurdsson equalise in his 100th appearance for the Welsh club with a 38th-minute curling shot But Mesut Ozil marked his 28th birthday by restoring Arsenal’s two-goal advantage with a 57th minute-volley. \n\nSwansea saw Borja Baston pull a goal back and Arsenal had to play the final 20 minutes a man down after Granit Xhaka received a straight red card for a challenge on Modou Barrow. \n\n“We could never capitalise on the two-goal cushion but at least we got the three points,” said Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager. \n\nTOTTENHAM 1, WEST BROM 1\n\nDele Alli rescued a point for Tottenham Hotspur in a 1-1 draw away to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday after it looked as if the Premier League high-flyers might suffer an agonising defeat. \n\nThe visitors dominated possession only for Nacer Chadli, a player Spurs sold to West Brom in pre-season, to put the hosts in front eight minutes from time against the run of play. \n\nBut Alli poked a low shot home in the 89th minute after a shot by Christian Eriksen had been blocked, with the draw seeing Spurs drop to third in the table after arch north London rivals Arsenal beat Swansea 3-2. \n\nCHELSEA 3, LEICESTER 0\n\nChelsea have heaped more away misery on Premier League champions Leicester City with a dominant 3-0 win. \n\nGoals from Diego Costa, Eden Hazard and Victor Moses made Chelsea deserved winners in the clash of the past two league winners at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. \n\nLeicester failed to put a shot on target in becoming the first defending top- flight champions to lose their opening four away matches since Blackburn Rovers in 1995-96. \n\n“You come to Chelsea and your attention must be at the maximum,” manager Claudio Ranieri told Sky Sports. \n\n“We made mistakes. We tried to react and the second half was much better. “But our approach to the match was not good. Maybe we were a little nervous.” The Foxes have allowed 13 goals in their travels so far after conceding just 18 away in last season’s title run. \n\nSTOKE CITY 2, SUNDERLAND 0\n\nJoe Allen scored twice as Stoke City collected their first win of the Premier League season on Saturday by defeating bottom side Sunderland 2-0 to climb out of the relegation zone. \n\nAllen headed in the opening goal after just eight minutes before the Wales midfielder doubled his tally with Stoke’s second in first-half stoppage time to end a seven-match winless run. \n\nMark Hughes’ side recorded their first clean sheet in 18 matches, a sequence dating back to last March, as the Potters climbed up to 17th place, two points above the bottom three. \n\nSunderland remain adrift at the foot of the table as the search for a first win under new manager David Moyes goes on.\n\nBOURNEMOUTH 6, HULL CITY 1\n\nElsewhere, Bournemouth thrashed Hull 6-1 as Mike Phelan’s first game in full-time charge of the Tigers ended in an a thumping defeat. \n\nCharlie Daniels put Bournemouth 1-0 up as early as the fifth minute. Hull’s Ryan Moses equalised in the 34th minute but from then on it was one-way traffic as Steve Cook and Junior Stanislas (two goals), Callum Wilson and Dan Gosling all finding the back of the net. \n\nPhelan, who took caretaker charge of Hull after former manager Steve Bruce left in pre-season, was scathing about his side’s display. \n\n“I feel very embarrassed,” he said. “We’ve got to grow up...What we’ve done today is not good enough.”\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE 0, WEST HAM 1\n\nWest Ham climbed out of the relegation zone with a 1-0 win away to London rivals Crystal Palace in Saturday’s late kick-off. \n\nManuel Lanzini’s 19th-minute goal proved decisive in a match where Palace’s Christian Benteke missed a penalty on the stroke of half-time. \n\nThe Hammers held out after being reduced to 10 men for the final 15 minutes after Aaron Cresswell was sent off for two bookable offences. \n\n","standFirst":"MANCHESTER City twice missed penalties in a 1-1 draw with Everton as 10-man Arsenal

the list of the best hidden gems Gippsland has to offer.\n\nCheck back tomorrow for more hidden gems from a different region.\n\nMORE: HIDDEN GEMS IN MELBOURNE’S CBD\n\nRELATED: MELBOURNE BAR AMONG WORLD’S BEST\n\nMORE: WHY EVERYONE WANTS A GOON SUIT\n\nBURGER BEST: WHERE TO FIND MELBOURNE’S BEST VEGGIE BURGER\n\n3260 South Gippsland Hwy, Tooradin.wingsandfins.com.au\n\nTooradin Airport has a joy flight like no other — delivery of live crayfish from Flinders Island. Nola de Lorenzo, who runs the airport’s Wings and Fins bistro, says: “Soon as those crays hit the tarmac, we’re loading them on to forklifts and getting them into tanks.’’ Locals have long known about Tooradin’s crayfish sales but as word spreads — thanks to an appearance on Channel 9 show The Hotplate — de Lorenzo is cooking and serving more cold-water crustaceans than ever. \n\nparkweb.vic.gov.au\n\nPristine and untamed, Croajingolong National Park is perfect for beachcombing, birdwatching and boating. But between river and ocean, near Cann River, there is a network of sandy trails that visitors to this corner of Gippsland often overlook. The Thurra River sand dunes soar 30m high in places, offering spectacular views of Croajingolong’s wilderness coastline. And while camping options close by are plentiful, you can also stay in a clifftop keeper cottage at Point Hicks lighthouse. Whale sightings are common. \n\n71 Tarraville Rd, Port Albert.\n\nA sleepy seaside village it might be, but Port Albert, Gippsland’s oldest port (c. 1841), has a gem of an eatery in its midst. To bypass the Port Albert Cafe and Wine Bar is to miss some of the best fish and chips in all of South Gippsland, not to mention the display of humungous cakes that proprietor Kim Wherrett makes almost daily. Then there’s the cellar. Wherrett — just as likely to be in the kitchen as serving dishes — has sourced almost every wine from Gippsland \n\nand sells them by the glass. \n\nNeerim South.neerimbower.com.auvisitvictoria.com\n\nDeep in the rolling green hills of West Gippsland, Neerim South is your typical country town. Or is it? There’s nothing typical about the bright blue sculpture that frames the town as you drive in. The Neerim Bower was inspired by birds and conceived by local artists. But its creation in 2014, as part of Victoria’s Small Town Transformations program, has encouraged other artistic projects in the district.\n\nFreestone Creek Rd, Briagolong. \n\nIt’s an open secret down Briagolong way that Blue Pool is one of Victoria’s best places for cooling down ... and jumping into. But out-of-towners are still discovering this Gippsland waterhole north of Maffra and falling for its aquatic charms. The emerald-green colour of the water comes from Freestone Creek winding its way through rain-soaked forest. \n\n75A Nicholson St, Bairnsdale. ifoundthefoundry.com\n\nFoundry hides its light under a considerable bushel. To find this unusual retail store, you go down a lane beside a supermarket, then look for the back of a bakery. But the artist collective representing 35 East Gippsland artists is worth seeking out for its handmade ceramics, jewellery and design objects. “Everything we put on the shelves is made in the district,’’ says co-founder Jes John. Ranging in price from $2 to $400, you’re sure to find something that suits. \n\nMitta Mitta River, Omeo. raftingaustralia.com\n\nThe Mitta Mitta River is well known for its whitewater thrills. Rafting Australia has been negotiating its rapids for years. But owners Linton and Tracey Smith, who know the river like the back of their oars, are still discovering new things about Granite River Gorge. Sign up for a one-day Mitta Mitta journey to see this wonder while riding 18km of crystal-clear mountain water. Led by experienced guides out of Omeo, the tour ($220 a person) suits novices (children from 12) and includes river equipment, river transfers and lunch.\n\nTraralgon Creek Rd, Loy Yang.visitlatrobecity.com \n\nPlumes of steam curling into the sky signal the presence of Loy Yang power station. But it’s only when you get off the South Gippsland Highway and drive up to Miners View lookout that the epic scale of this site comes into focus. The lookout, equipped with telescopes, takes in Loy Yang’s huge cooling towers and the open-cut mine next door, a great gouge in the ground where electric-powered bucket wheel dredgers can be seen toiling in the distance. \n\n150 Johnson St, Maffra. wellington.vic.gov.au\n\nIt’s tucked in a library but when it comes to art, Maffra Exhibition Space can punch above its weight. This “access gallery’’ (closed Sunday and Tuesday) focuses on Gippsland artists. In coming months, look out for landscapes by Graeme Myrteza. Around the corner, in Foster St, Maffra Bakery bakes the best pies in town. \n\n246 Samuel Amess Dr, Churchill Island.visitphillipisland.com\n\nPerused the penguins? Spotted the seals? It’s time you crossed the bridge from Phillip Island to Churchill Island Heritage Farm. This 57ha oasis has been farmed since the 1850s and was once owned by the mayor of Melbourne.

between samples obtained from the men and crucial evidence located inside Ms Connelly’s white Ford Econovan, which she worked out of as a sex worker.\n\nOver the past three years police have compiled the persons of interest list from police databases, social media, records of people in the area at the time and up to 3000 car registration numbers recorded by Ms Connelly’s long-time partner, Tony Melissovas, in the 18 months leading up to her death.\n\nPolice across the state are taking part in the operation to track down those identified who could potentially be linked Ms Connelly’s case.\n\nTracy’s van where she was found in St Kilda.\n\nThe investigation will spread across the state but a cluster of people to be contacted remain in the Port Phillip region of Melbourne.\n\nMost of those have never had their forensic samples recorded by police although it is possible the man investigators are looking for may have had their profile destroyed despite being convicted of serious crimes.\n\nMs Connelly’s body was found in her van which she used as a home and where she took sex clients in Greeves St, St Kilda on July 21, 2013.\n\nThe massive project demonstrates a great level of commitment to finding Ms Connelly’s murderer.\n\nConcerns, however, have been raised about the possibility the killer’s DNA could be missing from the police DNA database.\n\nThe Herald Sun exposed after the death of Jill Meagher in 2012 that Adrian Bayley’s DNA was not on the force’s database despite it being taken from him by police more than decade earlier.\n\nPolice command looked into the issue after the homicide squad looked for his DNA on its system and were shocked to find it was missing.\n\nTracy Connelly with son, Bill in 1993.\n\nThe Sunday Herald Sun is not suggesting Ms Connelly’s killer has previously produced a sample for police or that it has been lost or destroyed.\n\nBayley’s DNA was taken from him after he was arrested for the rape of sex workers in the St Kilda area in 2001, many of whom had to be convinced to work with police.\n\nBecause of an administrative issue, an unknown quantity of DNA samples have been destroyed because of a failure to apply for court orders to keep offenders’ DNA permanently on file.\n\nIn Bayley’s case, he was not automatically retrospectively put on the Sexual Offenders Register’ because his history of offending was not against children, as legislation stipulated, although one of his victims was a minor.\n\nHe had, however, been convicted of multiple rapes and sexual assaults years apart which should have led to his DNA being kept.\n\nMs Connelly worked and lived on the streets with her partner and her death sparked wide public reaction to violence against women.\n\nPolice did not hold an appeal for information to coincide with the third anniversary of her death this year as it began the painstaking task of conducting the wide-scale door knock.\n\nHomicide Inspector Mick Hughes last month vowed to catch Ms Connelly’s killer.\n\nFlowers and tributes to Tracy Connelly at the site of her murder.\n\nVictoria’s homicide squad has consistently worked towards identifying suspects in the Tracy Connelly murder case, following several leads, but none have identified a prime suspect.\n\nIt is not known if investigators were able to identify a man or a dark Ford XR6 ute caught by CCTV cameras near the crime scene in the early hours of the morning when Ms Connelly was attacked.\n\nShortly after the murder former homicide Inspector John Potter was confident they would catch the killer, declaring after his squad had found DNA: We’ve got good evidence from the scene, from the van,’’ he said. I’m confident we will make an arrest in this case.’’\n\nSeveral men known to police, both sex offenders and clients, have been cleared.\n\nMale DNA found at the scene was also tested against 192 countries through Interpol after national databases came up without a match.\n\nLast (SAT) night, Victoria Police released a statement from Homicide Squad chief Detective Inspector Mick Hughes saying there was “significant work to do.”\n\n“We still have significant work to do on the investigation into to Tracy Connelly’s death,” it read.\n\n“I want Tracy’s family and friends as well as the broader community to know the Homicide Squad is committed to bringing this investigation to a successful conclusion.”\n\nAnyone with information is asked to phone Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. \n\nTracy Connelly with son, Bill in 1991.\n\nTRACY Connelly’s killer must be brought to justice so her family can finally move on, they say.\n\nTracy’s brother, Les Toft, who lives in Queensland, yesterday told the Sunday Herald Sun how important it was to the family that her killer be found.\n\n“If someone has done something wrong, they should be held accountable,” he said.\n\n“People know they should think twice before committing such an atrocity, that they will get caught.”\n\nMr Toft said his sister was a kind woman with a wicked sense of humour, who “didn’t hurt anybody but herself”.\n\n“It’s hard to remember these things because you always expect your family to be with you right through your life,” he said.\n\nMr Toft said Tracy’s son was now 25.\n\n“He’s very much like her ... very intelligent, very funny,” he said.\n\nMr Toft added the whole family were praying for a breakthrough in the cold case.\n\n“It would bring us some closure to know what happened, but it doesn’t change the fact that, from our point of view, like everyone else who has suffered loss, it won’t bring her back. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\nHe said his sister now had a resting place after her ashes were buried in a serene plot in Queensland last year.\n\n“We just feel now that she’s home,” he said.\n\n“She’s still in our memories. It’s good if they find something, but it’s not going to change anything.\n\n“She’ll always be with us.”\n\nTracy’s father, Bryan Connelly, has never given up hope his daughter’s killer will be caught.\n\nMr Connelly, who also lives in Queensland, yesterday said police had informed him the investigation had been ramped up.\n\n“We are just so appreciative that people are still thinking about her outside of the family.\n\n“We are very grateful for all the support that the media and other people in the community are giving, especially Victoria Police, who seem to be very tireless. It’s really good,” Mr Connelly said.\n\nBut he added: “If they catch him, it’s not going to change the reality.”\n\nThree years ago Mr Connelly fronted a media conference with Tracy’s long-term partner, Tony Melissovas, appealing for witnesses to come forward.\n\nAt that 2013 media conference, Mr Connelly said Tracy’s killer needed to be stopped.\n\n“We really need to get him and bring him to justice, whoever it is,” he said.\n\nMr Connelly said he wanted people not to judge his daughter for her choice of profession.\n\n“I didn’t judge her. I don’t expect anyone else to judge her either,” he said.\n\nkath \n\npowley\n\n- Kathryn Powley and Elissa Doherty\n\n","standFirst":"AN unprecedented statewide manhunt to catch the killer of mum

fans at next year’s event will enter through a revamped grand entrance with the Tanderrum Bridge carrying fans from Birrarung Marr to a new-look tennis precinct like no other.\n\nThe traditional main entrance to Melbourne Park via steps leading to Rod Laver Arena will be off-limits from next year with spectators instead urged to enter from the opposite end of the precinct.\n\nAustralian Open director Craig Tiley said it would “turn the focal entry or front of the site from the river to the city’’.\n\n“The connection to the city is what we’re all about and this makes it more formal and more specific,’’ he said.\n\nHe said the site would be “switched around’’ so the main entrance faced the CBD with construction of the new footbridge expected to be finished next month and turnstiles installed this summer.\n\n“This will of course be our primary entrance,’’ he said.\n\nAlternative gates will be opened next to HiSense Arena and at the existing tram entrance through Garden Square.\n\nIn other changes, Grand Slam Oval will be turned into a food and entertainment precinct themed on London, New York and Paris in tribute to Wimbledon and the US and French Opens.\n\nThe precinct, previously a popular band zone, will feature a Paris Quarter with crepes, macaroons and wine, an English pub and garden zone and a “Big Apple’’ area with hotdogs and burgers.\n\nAs revealed in the Herald Sun last week, nightly bands will be moved to a larger site at Birrarung Marr and rebranded The Open Sessions.\n\nA free two-day music festival will rock the site before next year’s event starts on January 16.\n\nAnd, for the first time, a mini theme park called The Ballpark, will offer a dedicated kids zone featuring a Lego Land, Nerf Battlezone and Adventure Park.\n\nOpen organisers will undertake the biggest push to lure Asian tourists in the event’s history in the lead-up to January’s Grand Slam with event launches in China, Japan and Singapore for the first time.\n\nIt comes as an economic impact study into this year’s event found 48 per cent of fans were from outside Melbourne.\n\nAbout 26percent were from interstate, 13percent from overseas and nine per cent from regional Victoria.\n\nVisitors in town for the tournament stayed an average 5.11 nights in Melbourne hotel rooms and spent $181 per day, the report found.\n\npeter.rolfe@news.com.au\n\n@rolfep\n\n","standFirst":"A NEW main entrance and pedestrian bridge to the Australian Open will next year move the focus of Melbourne’s Grand Slam towards the

man must now report to police annually, disclose all computer usernames and social media accounts and notify authorities if he wants to go on holidays for more than a weekend.\n\nSentencing him last week, County Court judge Jane Patrick said the case was completely different to the usual child pornography cases heard by the court.\n\n“This is a very unusual case. The law says that people may not keep images of a sexual nature of children. Usually such images are kept for sexual motivation,” she said. \n\n“That is not the case in your situation. You kept the images, I am satisfied, because you were very concerned about what had been going on and foolishly decided that this was the way to deal with it \n\n“Nevertheless the message has to get out to everybody that sexual images of children must not be kept on computers or any other form of equipment.”\n\nThe man caught his teen stepdaughter sexting her boyfriend, confiscated her phone and reported the matter to her school, and police. \n\nBefore returning the girl’s phone the man copied the 18 images to a USB and computer because he wanted police to investigate the matter further. \n\nHe reported the images to the girl’s school and the education department.\n\nThe man said he kept the images until he received a “satisfactory response” by police who had warned him that keeping the pictures stored was an offence. \n\nUltimately police searched the man’s home and seized two USBs and a laptop containing the images then charged him with possessing child pornography. \n\nHe pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography and was this week placed on a good behaviour bond, but was required to be placed on the sex offenders register for eight years.\n\n“I didn’t even understand it fell under child pornography,” the man told the Herald Sun.\n\n“I also made a copy for the school and the police. The police then interviewed me and my step daughter separately but said it appeared to be consensual. \n\n“No one told me that this is child pornography so delete it. My solicitor made the point ‘why would he go to the police if he had anything to hide?”\n\nJudge Patrick said the case highlighted danger associated with sexting, that she said was becoming more prevalent among teens.\n\nShe said the offending was at the lowest end of its kind.\n\n“There’s no suggestion of any exploitation of them by anybody. You made no attempt to conceal the images from anybody.”\n\nThe man said being placed on the sex offenders register was tough and dented his chances of getting a job.\n\n“What’s hard for me is this register thing,” he said. \n\n“I didn’t create this stuff, I didn’t distribute it. By law it’s mandatory that they put you on this register. But I could tell that the judge didn’t really want to do it,” he said.\n\nshannon.deery@news.com.au\n\n@s_deery\n\n","standFirst":"A DAD who reported his stepdaughter to police and her school for

1000: Garth Tander slams Jamie Whincup after late-race crash","userOriginUpdated":"burtonj","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Garth-Tander-slams-Jamie-Whincup-after-laterace-crash-ended-his-Bathurst-1000-hopes","revision":3,"body":"And HRT team owner Ryan Walkinshaw didn’t hold back either, saying the team had been “robbed” after the dramatic three-car incident on lap 150 that ended the race hopes of Tander, Scott McLaughlin and Whincup at Mount Panorama.\n\nIt all started when Whincup tried a passing move on the inside of McLaughlin, forcing the Volvo driver off the track. When McLaughlin found his way back onto the track he then collided with Tander, who was wedged in behind Whincup, forcing the HRT veteran crashing into the wall.\n\nCRASHES: ‘Metal Grate’ sparks Bathurst carnage\n\nTHE RACE: Bathurst 1000 sealed with a shoey\n\nSUPERCARS: Trailblazer Simona is chasing podiums\n\nHOLDSWORTH: ‘Everyone is devastated to start like that’\n\nWhincup was hit with a 15-second penalty for the driving infringement, while McLaughlin was to face post-race investigation for dangerous re-entry.\n\nTander, who was fourth and in pursuit of his second enduro win after his stunning victory at Sandown, said immediately after the incident he blamed Whincup for starting the chain reaction.\n\n“Whincup unloaded McLaughlin then decided to jump on the brakes to try and re-address it and then Scotty came back on and there was contact,’’ Tander said.\n\n“Whincup started it all so they probably should look at that.\n\n“It’s a bit surreal at the moment. It was obviously a fuel race, we were saving a lot of fuel, we were way ahead of target.\n\n“Jamie was being pretty desperate, Scotty made a small mistake at forest elbow and Jamie decided to pounce but it wasn’t on.’’\n\nA shattered Tander was not the only one left seething, with Walkinshaw taking out his frustrations on Twitter after the race.\n\n“A @Holden_racing Bathurst win robbed from us with 10 laps to go by two people running out of talent who should know better. Gutting,’’ Walkinshaw tweeted.\n\n“So take out a car then block the car behind you whilst attempting to redress, causing the two cars involved to crash. 15 second penalty.’’\n\nTander, whose future is unclear after losing his seat at Walkinshaw Racing for next year, later said he would have expected more from a six-time champion. \n\n“It was a disappointing end to what was looking like a promising race. It’s a shame we got caught in other people’s dramas and you would expect more from a six time champion and a four-time winner of this race. To drive the way he did was disappointing,’’ Tander said.\n\n“I can’t change the result but at least it shows we were in for the win, we had plenty of fuel up our sleeve and we could have pressed on to the end but it just wasn’t to be.’’\n\nHRT team principal Adrian Burgess said the team had been cruelled by “someone’s ambitious manoeuvre” and “dangerous re-entry”.\n\n“Clearly we are all a bit devastated. We didn’t have the quickest car this weekend but we’ve got a bloody good team here and we bought ourselves a ticket to the last 20 laps with Luffy (Warren Luff) and GT. We were in a good position and we were good on fuel,’’ Burgess said. \n\n“Those around us were definitely in a lot more pain than we were and we get taken out by someone’s ambitious manoeuvre and someone else’s dangerous re-entry.\n\n“But this is Bathurst and they don’t call it heartbreak hill for nothing. We are all gutted but this is motorsport, we’ll pick ourselves up and go to the Gold Coast with a spring in our step and try and repeat what we did there last year.’’\n\n","standFirst":"A DEVASTATED

ONE\n\nTRADEHQ: LATEST NEWS AND WHISPERS\n\nADELAIDE\n\nGONE: Nathan van Berlo, Matthew Jaensch (retired), Luke Lowden, Keenan Ramsey (delisted) \n\nIN PLAY: Out-of-contract swingman Ricky Henderson is surplus to Adelaide’s needs and should find a new home during the trade period. Jarryd Lyons will test the market after not being happy with the offer on the table. The 24-year-old has been linked to Gold Coast.\n\nTHE TARGETS: Been sniffing around Carlton star Bryce Gibbs for a long time, but a move appears unlikely. \n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 13, 50, 68, 86, 104\n\nBRISBANE LIONS\n\nGONE: Justin Clarke, Trent West, Daniel Merrett (retired), Jackson Paine, Hugh Beasley, Billy Evans, Josh Watts, Josh McGuinness (delisted)\n\nIN PLAY: Pearce Hanley appears to have out-stayed his welcome and could be off to cross-town rival Gold Coast or to Geelong. Captain Tom Rockliff’s name continues to come up in trade talks. How will his meeting with new coach Chris Fagan go?\n\nTHE TARGETS: Collingwood’s Jack Frost will head north on a three-year deal. The Lions are also keen on Melbourne defender Lynden Dunn.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT ORDER: 2, 19, 21, 29, 48, 57, 75\n\nCARLTON\n\nGONE: Matthew Dick, Jayden Foster, Clem Smith (delisted), Michael Jamison, Andrew Walker, Cameron Wood (retired)\n\nIN PLAY: Zach Tuohy has baulked at a two-year deal, with North Melbourne and Geelong circling for his services. \n\nTHE TARGETS: Caleb Marchbank will get to the Blues, but at what price? The Blues will want to hold onto No.5, or at least secure a later first-round selection in return. Expect GWS to try and bundle in James Stewart with Marchbank in a direct swap for No.5. That would place seven former Giants on the Stephen Silvagni’s list.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 5, 24, 42, 55, 78, 96\n\nCOLLINGWOOD\n\nGONE: Tim Golds, Matthew Goodyear, Darrean Wyatt (delisted), Brent Macaffer, Dane Swan, Alan Toovey (retired)\n\nIN PLAY: Travis Cloke’s move to premiers Western Bulldogs appears a fait accompli and should go through relatively quickly. Jack Frost is set to sign with Brisbane, while Jarrod Witts is likely to join Gold Coast. Whisper is restricted free agent Nathan Brown will reject North Melbourne’s offer to stay put.\n\nTHE TARGETS: Have dangled big-money multi-year deals at free agents Chris Mayne and Daniel Wells and both should get done as a matter of course. Giant Will Hoskin-Elliott also been courted by the Pies promising greater playing prospects.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 26, 44, 62, 80, 98\n\nESSENDON\n\nGONE: Jason Ashby, Ryan Crowley, Matt Dea, Shaun Edwards, Nathan Grima, Sam Grimley, James Gwilt, Mark Jamar, James Kelly, Sam Michael, James Polkinghorne, Jonathan Simpkin, Tom Wallis (delisted), Adam Cooney, Tayte Pears (retired)\n\nIN PLAY: Michael Hibberd’s trade to Melbourne will get done with the cost likely to be second-round pick. \n\nTHE TARGETS: Bulldogs midfielder Koby Stevens remains unsigned and could make the switch to Tullamarine. Could look at contracted Brisbane Lions skipper Tom Rockliff should he decide to leave the Gabba for a fresh start.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 1, 20, 38, 56, 74, 92\n\nFREMANTLE\n\nGONE: Matthew Pavlich (retired), Sean Hurley, Tanner Smith, Anthony Morabito, Tendai Mzungu, Matt de Boer, Clancee Pearce, Jack Hannath, Brady Grey, Josh Deluca (delisted)\n\nIN PLAY: After seven years out west, Michael Barlow is unlikely to remain a Docker. Hayden Ballantyne has been linked with a move to West Coast and will likely head east if a trade to the rival can’t be struck. Chris Mayne will join Collingwood.\n\nTHE TARGETS: Hawthorn’s Brad Hill is set to join brother Stephen at the Dockers, most likely at the cost of the compensation selection received for Mayne. After sitting out the 2016 season, Cam McCarthy is likely to return to football with Fremantle and the Dockers could also target fellow West Australian Shane Kersten. Interest is rising in premiership defender Joel Hamling, another local product.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT ORDER: 3, 40, 58, 76\n\nGEELONG\n\nGONE: Corey Enright (retired), Zac Bates, Cameron Delaney, Padraig Lucey, Tom Read, Jock Cornell (delisted)\n\nIN PLAY: Steven Motlop is under pressure after a slim September campaign. Out-of-favour forward Shane Kersten has been linked with a move to Perth and Nathan Vardy could be another tall on the way out.\n\nTHE TARGETS: The Cats want to add another star midfielder and are targeting one of Brett Deledio, Daniel Wells or Pearce Hanley. Could Hayden Ballantyne slot into Geelong’s forward line?\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT ORDER: 35, 39, 53, 71, 88, 89\n\nGOLD COAST\n\nGONE: Seb Tape, Luke Russell, Danny Stanley, Tom Keough (delisted)\n\nIN PLAY: Jaeger O’Meara wants to head to Hawthorn and Dion Prestia has nominated Richmond. Will they end up there? The Suns will play hardball on O’Meara, but expect both trades to get done.\n\nTHE TARGETS: Who isn’t a target? It feels like the Suns are after anyone and everyone in this year’s trade period. Docker Michael Barlow could find himself on the Gold Coast and the Suns are still in the hunt for Pearce Hanley and Jarrod Witts. Missed out on Lin Jong and Hamish Hartlett.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 4, 8 (from Melbourne), 22 (from Fremantle), 23, 25 (from Richmond), 28 (from Port Adelaide), 41, 59\n\nGWS GIANTS\n\nGONE: None as yet\n\nIN PLAY: Quite a few. Midfielder Jack Steele wants to play for St Kilda, Caleb Marchbank has requested a move to Carlton and homesick forward Cam McCarthy wants to head home to WA. Wingman Will Hoskin-Elliott is in Collingwood’s sights while James Stewart is likely to end up at the Magpies or Blues.\n\nTHE TARGETS: The Giants would love to snatch this year’s No.1 draft pick to secure Sandringham Dragons jet Andy McGrath in addition to another sparkling academy bunch, led by Will Setterfield and Harry Perryman.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 7 (from Collingwood), 15, 16 (from Geelong via Carlton), 32 (from Adelaide), 34, 52, 70\n\nHAWTHORN\n\nGONE: Shem-Kalvin Tatupu (retired)\n\nIN PLAY: Brad Hill wants to play alongside brother Stephen at Fremantle and will likely net a draft pick in the early 20s. Luke Breust’s name has been raised as possible trade bait to help land slick midfielder Jaeger O’Meara. Premiership player Will Langford could also be on the move while clubs are talking about promising forward James Sicily. Promising defender Kaiden Brand should re-sign.\n\nTHE TARGETS: Blockbuster trade period coming up with deals to be done for Jaeger O’Meara and Tom Mitchell. Ty Vickery, a restricted free agent, will join the Hawks on a two-year deal worth close to $1m, as long as Richmond doesn’t match the offer.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 14, 33, 51, 69, 87, 105\n\nMELBOURNE\n\nGONE: Jack Grimes, Matt Jones, Dean Terlich (delisted)\n\nIN PLAY: Chris Dawes is yet to receive a fresh contract offer while Lynden Dunn is tipped to join Brisbane Lions after falling out of favour.\n\nTHE TARGETS: Michael Hibberd is the man and is expected to only cost pick No.27, delivering a lean draft year for the Demons. A back-up ruckman to Gawn is also on the wish list.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 27, 45, 63, 81\n\nNORTH MELBOURNE\n\nGONE: Nick Dal Santo, Drew Petrie, Robbie Nahas, Farren Ray, Brent Harvey, Michael Firrito (retired)\n\nIN PLAY: Daniel Wells looks to be on the move to Collingwood on a three-year mega deal. Brad McKenzie and Joel Tippett might struggle to hold their spots on the list with no contracts on the table.\n\nTHE TARGETS: The Roos have trumped Carlton with a four-year deal to lure Zach Tuohy, yet to sign a three-year deal to stay at Princes Park. North has its eye on young Crows forward Harry Dear. They also want Collingwood key defender Nathan Brown.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 11, 30, 66, 84, 102\n\nPORT ADELAIDE\n\nGONE: Alipate Carlile (retired), John Butcher, Jay Schulz, Kane Mitchell, Sam Colquhoun (delisted)\n\nIN PLAY: The Hamish Hartlett saga is set to fizzle with the expensive midfielder now likely to stay. Matthew Lobbe’s value has gone through the floor while unsigned defender Cameron O’Shea is also on the market. Lobbe is rated a 50-50 chance to stay with Paddy Ryder set to take the No.1 ruck mantle.\n\nTHE TARGETS: A salary cap squeeze means the draft is likely to be the main target for the Power. Ryder and Angus Monfries are effectively 2017 recruits after serving drug bans.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 9, 46, 64, 82\n\nRICHMOND\n\nGONE: Troy Chaplin, Reece McKenzie (retired), Liam McBean, Adam Marcon (delisted)\n\nIN PLAY: The Brett Deledio trade talk refuses to go away with Geelong keen on the star Tiger. Richmond is unlikely to match Tyrone Vickery’s free agency offer from Hawthorn. Ben Lennon requested a trade as soon as the season was over. Reece Conca is also likely to find a second home.\n\nTHE TARGETS: Dion Prestia will be at Tigerland next year. The only question is, how much will he cost? Tigers would love to find a way to land Prestia and hold onto pick No.6, and Deledio could be the answer.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT ORDER: 6, 43, 61, 79\n\nST KILDA\n\nGONE: Luke Delaney, Tom Curren, Josh Saunders, Brenton Payne (delisted)\n\nIN PLAY: St Kilda has plenty of ruck depth and rival clubs have enquired about Billy Longer. The club says he is a required player.\n\nTHE TARGETS: The Saints have already had a win with GWS midfielder Jack Steele declaring he wants to join the club. Don’t rule out another inside midfielder lobbing at Seaford.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT ORDER: 10, 47, 65, 83\n\nSYDNEY SWANS\n\nGONE: Ted Richards, Ben McGlynn (retired), Tom Derickx, Kyle Galloway (delisted)\n\nIN PLAY: The big one is Tom Mitchell, who is set to declare his intentions on Monday. Hawthorn looms large, but the Swans won’t let him go without a fight. Ruckman Toby Nankervis may also head to Richmond.\n\nTHE TARGETS: The Swans don’t need a whole lot, but they surely would love to get up the draft order given their first pick is at 17. Swans are also having a look at Zach Tuohy.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 17, 36, 54, 90\n\nWEST COAST\n\nGONE: Xavier Ellis, Damien Cavka, Kane Lucas, Patrick McGinnity (retired), Jamie Bennell, Brant Colledge, Alec Waterman, Corey Adamson (delisted)\n\nIN PLAY: Key defender Eric Mackenzie is on Essendon’s radar where he would link up with former coach John Worsfold. Mitch Brown looks likely to leave in free agency.\n\nTHE TARGETS: With Nic Naitanui set for a long stint on the sidelines, the Eagles are chasing delisted Roo Drew Petrie. Would they take a look at Will Minson? Fremantle forward Hayden Ballantyne could also make the switch to the Eagles. \n\nNATIONAL DRAFT ORDER: 12, 31, 49, 67, 85\n\nWESTERN BULLDOGS\n\nGONE: Jed Adcock (retired), Luke Goetz (delisted)\n\nIN PLAY: Premiership defender Joel Hamling remains unsigned as his value rockets. Midfielder Koby Stevens looks set to leave, as does uncontracted small forward Nathan Hrovat. Will Minson retired from the club but would go another season elsewhere, while All-Australian Matthew Boyd’s future remains unclear.\n\nTHE TARGETS: The Travis Cloke trade should be fairly straight-forward. He is expected to cost the Dogs just pick No.72, with Collingwood happy to free up salary cap space by offloading their hulking goalkicker. Other than that expect a quiet October, with the Dogs’ list strategy now geared around retention.\n\nNATIONAL DRAFT PICKS: 18, 37, 55 (from Carlton), 60, 72 (from Sydney), 73\n\n","standFirst":"WHO’S in demand?

manager Phil Mullen, of Stride Sports, will meet Swans’ officials and an announcement is expected late Monday or early Tuesday.\n\nMullen denied a deal had already been struck with the Hawks.\n\nLIVE BLOG: DON’T MISS A DEAL ON DAY ONE\n\nSEASON REVIEW: SYDNEY SWANS’ 2016 REPORT CARD\n\nALASTAIR CLARKSON: ‘GET READY, WE’RE COMING AGAIN IN 2017’\n\n“People know more than we do,” Mullen said.\n\n“We’re still in negotiations, we’re meeting with Sydney (Monday).\n\n“We made an agreement that we would talk to Sydney at the end of the season, and we will do that.”\n\nThe Hawks are armed with draft pick No.14 but if they swap that for Mitchell it would place more stress on striking a trade with Gold Coast for Jaeger O’Meara.\n\nThe Herald Sun understands Mitchell, 23, met with at least one other Victorian club last week in a certain sign the Grand Final was his final performance for the Swans.\n\nSwans chief executive Andrew Ireland, who flew to Rome on Saturday, was not aware of Mitchell’s future when contacted by the Herald Sun.\n\nTRADEHQ: LATEST NEWS AND WHISPERS\n\nThe Swans will officially learn Mitchell’s plans on Monday. \n\nHawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson and captain Luke Hodge both declared how proud the Hawks were to be a destination club at Saturday night’s best-and-fairest count.\n\nClarkson said: “Wrighty (list chief Graeme Wright), get to work lad. You’ve got some important stuff to do over the next couple of weeks.\n\n“Players want to come to our footy club because of (fitness coach) Andrew Russell and his team.\n\n“That’s really, really special in terms of being a destination club. A lot of it has got to do with our medical and conditioning team.”\n\nClarkson signed off with a warning: “Get ready, we’re coming in 2017” with the Hawks set for a busy off-season.\n\nRichmond will not match Hawthorn’s offer for Tyrone Vickery, meaning the forward will this week join the Hawks on a two-year contract worth close to $500,000 per season.\n\nSilky midfielder O’Meara, 22, and inside ballwinner Mitchell will help regenerate Clarkson’s ageing engine room.\n\nMitchell enjoyed a career-best season, averaging 28 disposals and recording his best finish in the Bob Skilton Medal — eighth. \n\nMitchell led the Swans in tackles and slotted 15 goals, including two during his team’s second-quarter Grand Final burst.\n\n","standFirst":"TOM Mitchell is set to tell Sydney he wants to

was among 2000 athletes at the starting line of the gruelling 226.2km journey — a 3.8km swim, 180km of cycling and 42km run — yesterday.\n\nThe courageous Aussie athlete was backed by her fiance, Michael Hoskin, and support crew.\n\nDoctors told Pitt she would never run again when she suffered burns to 65 per cent of body in 2011 after being caught in a freak firestorm in Western Australia during an ultra-marathon.\n\nYesterday, she looked confident when she entered the final run, which passes through infamous lava fields and proves the biggest challenge for competitors.\n\nBefore the race, Pitt said the final section of the Ironman World Championships would be tough test. \n\n“Because of my burns, I can’t regulate my own body temperature. I have to make adjustments or use standard tri gear in different ways ... I will need things such as cooling sleeves and white suits to deal with the heat in Kona,’’ she said.\n\n“I’d rather take a crack at it and fail than not even try at all.”\n\n","standFirst":"INSPIRING

Bali: Australian Guiseppe Serafino and UK man in drug arrest","userOriginUpdated":"willisc","systemOriginUpdated":"METHODE","domainOriginUpdated":"None","urlTitle":"Australian-man-Guiseppe-Serafino-and-a-UK-man-held-in-Bali-over-drug-possesssion","revision":7,"body":"The two men were arrested on the weekend and are now in custody at Denpasar police station facing interrogation on drugs possession laws which carry a maximum 12-year jail term.\n\nThe Australian man was identified by police as 48-year-old Guiseppe Serafino and his companion, known only as DM, is a 54-year old British journalist born in the town of Shrewsbury in Shropshire, England. Police said both had been living in Bali for five years.\n\nThe men were both arrested on Saturday after what police say was a tip off from the community about a man at the address of the Australian, who allegedly often used drugs.\n\nDenpasar police chief, Hadi Purnomo, said police had gone to the home of the. Australian, in Sanur, where they allegedly found Serafino and hashish weighing 7.2 grams inside a black bag.\n\nMr Purnomo claimed the Australian told police he got the drugs from his friend, DM, who he agreed to meet, in an apparent police sting, in the nearby ON ON Bar.\n\nAt the bar DM was arrested and hashish was allegedly seized. He was then brought to his home, also in Sanur, where more hashish was allegedly seized along with a bong. The total hashish allegedly seized at the bar and at DMs home was 10.09 grams.\n\nPolice allege that DM told them he got the drugs from someone whose identity he didn’t know.\n\nBoth men are now being held at the Denpasar police stations drug squad holding cells pending further investigations. They are yet to be fully interrogated with a translator.\n\nThey are being investigated under article 112 of Indonesia’s harsh anti-drugs laws for drug possession, which carries a maximum 12-year term.\n\nThis is the same police station where Australian woman Sara Connor and her British boyfriend David Taylor have been held since August 19 as suspects in the murder of a Bali police officer.\n\nProsecutors in their case are expected on Monday to make a decision on whether the brief of evidence agains the couple is completed and the case is ready for court.\n\nThe two drugs suspects are being held in holding cells in the drug squad section of the police station. Connor and Taylor are now in the general downstairs holding cells.\n\nIf prosecutors pursue charges against the pair, they will be transferred to Kerobokan jail to await trial as soon as the case is declared complete and ready. \n\nIndonesia has harsh anti-drugs laws and the Australian man arrested on the weekend is the latest of his countrymen to find himself behind bars for a small amount of drugs. Even small amounts are not tolerated in Indonesia and can earn people months of jail time. Large amounts can see life sentences and even the death penalty imposed.\n\n","standFirst":"AN Australian man and his British friend have been locked up in Bali, accused of possession of 17.41 grams

The proceeds from the sale of Anna Creek and the Peake will be paid to Kidman and retained in the company for the benefit of AOB, effectively reducing the “net price” being paid by AOB for the remaining Kidman portfolio to approximately $365M.\n\nHancock Prospecting chairwoman Gina Rinehart said she was pleased to have the opportunity to invest further in Australia’s cattle holdings through the acquisition of the Kidman stations and was looking forward to working with the Kidman management and staff to grow and develop the operations.\n\n“Kidman is an iconic cattle business established more than a century ago by Sir Sidney Kidman. It is an operation founded on hard work and perseverance by an outstanding Australian, and is an important part of Australia’s pioneering and entrepreneurial history,” Mrs Rinehart said.\n\nHancock CEO Garry Korte said the quality of the Kidman herd and channel country properties complemented Hancock’s existing northern cattle properties, and aligned well with Mrs Rinehart’s plans to build a diversified cattle holding in Australia, taking advantage of integration opportunities.”\n\nThe Hancock family started their first cattle station in North West Australia, and founded the first port in the area at Cossack on the West Pilbara Coast to enable the cattle trade.\n\nSince then Mrs Rinehart has extensively grown the Hancock portfolio of cattle stations including legendary Kimberley Station Fossil Downs, a 400,000ha property in Western Australia.\n\nShanghai CRED principal Gui Guojie said that partnering with leading local business Hancock had already proved to be a productive approach and that he looked forward to having the opportunity to work with Hancock through the Kidman investment.\n\nMore than 600 interested parties have held discussions with sale manager Ernst & Young since the iconic Kidman landholding went on sale almost 18 months ago.\n\nS. Kidman & Co Ltd is one of Australia’s largest beef producers, with an average herd carrying capacity of 185,000 cattle. The company has pastoral leases covering 101,000sqkm across South Australia, Western Australia, Northern Territory, and Queensland.\n\n","standFirst":"MINING magnate Gina Rinehart and Chinese Real Estate company Shanghai Cred have entered into a bid implementation agreement to make a takeover offer for the nations largest private land hold S Kidman and Co.\n\n","kicker":"Exclusive","byline":"Samantha Townsend","commentsAllowed":true,"commentsTotal":0,"commentsShown":true,"authorProfileIds":[],"bylineNames":["Samantha Townsend"],"bylineTitles":[],"bulletList":[]}],"resultSize":100,"warnings":[]}
